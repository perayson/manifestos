A Labour government would ramp up mass immigration, crime, and taxes even further. Labour and the Tories are two sides of the same coin. Only Reform UK is ready to stand up for common sense politics. We set out our plan in this document, Our Contract with You. Wherever you look, Britain needs Reform. Our Contract with You covers the most important areas of policy for you and your family, but we have summarised these into five core pledges: 1. Imagine Smart Immigration, Not Mass Immigration All non-essential immigration frozen to boost wages, protect public services, end the housing crisis and cut crime. 2. Imagine No More Small Boats in the Channel Illegal migrants who come to the UK will be detained and deported. And if needed, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France. 3. Imagine No NHS Waiting Lists Still free at the point of delivery, healthcare needs reform to improve outcomes and enjoy zero NHS waiting lists. Cut back office waste to spend more money on the frontline. Tax breaks for doctors and nurses to tackle the staffing crisis. 4. Imagine Good Wages for a Hard Day’s Work Lift the income tax starting threshold to £20k to save the lowest paid £1,500 per year. This takes 7 million of the least well-off out of Income Tax to make work pay and get people off benefits. 5. Imagine Affordable, Stable Energy Bills Scrap energy levies and Net Zero to slash energy bills and save each household £500 per year. Unlock Britain’s vast oil and gas reserves to beat the cost of living crisis and unleash real economic growth. This is whatThis is what Reform UK MPs willReform UK MPs will fight hard for if elected.fight hard for if elected.So if you want change,So if you want change, vote for it on July 4th.vote for it on July 4th. Vote Reform UKVote Reform UK to get reform.to get reform. REFORM UK 2024 2 IMMIGRATION Uncontrolled Immigration has Pushed Britain to Breaking Point “Securing our borders to boost your wages and protect public services and British culture and values.” Reform UK will secure Britain’s borders to protect wages, our public services, and British culture and values. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Freeze Non-Essential Immigration Strict limits on immigration are the only way to relieve the pressure on our housing, public services, increase wages and protect our culture, identity and values. Essential skills, mainly around healthcare, must be the only exception. Stop the Boats with our 4 Point Plan Leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Zero illegal immigrants to be resettled in the UK. New Department of Immigration. Pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France. Secure Detention for all Illegal Migrants All asylum seekers that arrive illegally from safe countries will be processed rapidly, offshore if necessary. Those entering from a safe country will also be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship. No legal aid for non-citizens. Those rejected will be returned. Immediate Deportation for Foreign Criminals Deport foreign nationals immediately after their prison sentence ends. Withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit crime with the exception of some misdemeanour offences. Bar Student Dependents Introduce new visa rules for international students that bar dependents. Only international students with essential skills can remain in the UK. Close down fake courses and immigration schemes that abuse the rules. Stop Health Tourism and Immediate Access to Benefits We will impose a requirement of 5 years residency and employment to claim any benefits in the UK. Employer Immigration Tax The National Insurance rate will be raised to 20% for foreign workers. This would incentivise businesses to employ British citizens whose National Insurance rate would stay at 13.8%. Essential foreign health and care workers would be exempt from the tax, as would businesses who employ 5 staff members and under. This would boost wages and could raise more than £20 billion over five years to pay for apprenticeships and training for young Brits. IMMIGRATION PLEDGES SAVINGS = £5-10 BILLION PAEMPLOYER IMMIGRATION TAX = £4BN PA REFORM UK 2024 3 SLASH GOVERNMENT WASTE Government Spending Needs Major Reform Reform UK will slash wasteful spending to increase funding for frontline public services and reduce taxes for working people. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Bank of England Must Stop Paying Interest to Commercial Banks on QE Reserves This approach would save around £35 billion per year and has been endorsed by senior figures at the Financial Times, New Economics Foundation, and IFS, as well as two former Deputy Governors of the Bank of England. Save £5 in every £100 Every department must slash wasteful spending, cut bureaucracy, improve efficiency and negotiate “Reform UK will make sure taxpayers’ money is never wasted.” better value procurement without touching frontline services. This will save £50 billion per year, ensure tax cuts and boost our economy. Brexit Bonus. Cut Unnecessary Regulations Britain still retains over 6,700 EU laws. Government red tape and nanny state regulations are estimated to have cost the UK economy £143 billion since 2015. That means £ billions lost in growth and taxes. Cut Foreign Aid by 50% Save £6 billion from the £12.8 billion budget. A major review is needed into the effectiveness of overseas aid. That includes global quangos to which we pay over £7 billion every year. Collect £ Billions in Unpaid Tax HM Revenue and Customs failed to collect tens of billions in taxes last year due to understaffing and bad management. Improved HMRC competence would deliver lower taxes to British workers. SLASH GOVERNMENT WASTE: POTENTIAL SAVINGS = £91 BILLION PA REFORM UK 2024 ECONOMY - PERSONAL Our Economy Needs Reform Reform UK will make work pay and help the unemployed to escape the benefits trap.CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Make Work Pay. Lift the Income Tax Start Point to £20,000 Per Year This frees up to 7 million people from paying Income Tax and saves every worker almost £1,500 per year. Basic Tax rate stays at 20%. The higher rate should begin at £70,000. Cut Energy Taxes, Beat the Cost-of-Living Crisis Save households over £500 per year. Lower fuel duty by 20p per litre for both residential and business users. Scrap VAT on energy bills. Scrap environmental levies. Cut Residential Stamp Duty Substantially boost economic activity and housebuilding by cutting Stamp Duty to 0% below £750k. Cut it to 2% from £750k - £1.5m and cut it to 4% over £1.5m. Abolish the VAT Tourist Tax The government has cost our economy over £10 billion when they stopped the VAT refund scheme for tourist shopping. This also deterred up to 2 million tourists. Abolish Inheritance Tax (IHT) for all Estates Under £2m That means some 98% of all estates. The rate above £2m will be 20% tax, with the option to donate to charity instead. REFORM UK 2024 5 “Reform UK will take 7 million people out of Income Tax.” ECONOMY - PERSONAL PLEDGES COSTS = £70 BILLION PA ECONOMY - BUSINESS Our Economy Needs Reform Reform UK will back risk takers and wealth creators and make sure that Britain is open for business. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Free Over 1.2 Million Small and Medium Sized Businesses from Corporation Tax Lift the minimum profit threshold to £100k. Reduce the main Corporation Tax Rate from 25% to 20%, then to 15% from Year 3. Abolish IR35 Rules to Support Sole Traders Britain’s self-employed often work longer hours and take more risks. Many have no pension and receive no sick pay. Lift the VAT Threshold to £150,000 Free up small entrepreneurs from red tape. Thereafter: Support Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Abolish Business Rates for high street based SMEs. Offset this with Online Delivery Tax at 4% for large, multinational enterprises to create a fairer playing field for high streets. Cut entrepreneurs’ tax to 5%. Reform the Planning System Fast-track new housing on brownfield sites and infrastructure projects to boost businesses, especially in coastal regeneration areas, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. Slash Red Tape to Boost Industry and Exports Scrap thousands of laws that hold back British business and damage productivity, including employment laws. We must make it easier to hire and fire so that businesses can grow. Reform the Tax System Major simplification is needed. At over 21,000 pages, the UK’s tax code is a burden. Hong Kong’s tax code is under 500 pages. REFORM UK 2024 6 “Reform UK will back risk takers and wealth creators.” ECONOMY - BUSINESS PLEDGES COSTS = £18 BILLION PA NHS The NHS Needs Urgent Reform Despite record extra funding in recent years, NHS healthcare outcomes have declined. While still free at the point of delivery, our healthcare needs major reforms to improve results and enjoy zero waiting lists. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: End Doctor and Nurse Shortages All frontline NHS and social care staff to pay zero basic rate tax for 3 years. This will help retain existing staff and attract many who have left to return. End training caps for all UK medical students. Write off student fees pro rata per year over 10 years of NHS service for all doctors, nurses and medical staff. Use Independent Healthcare Capacity We will harness independent and not-for-profit health provision in the UK and overseas. Tax Relief of 20% on all Private Healthcare and Insurance This will improve care for all by relieving pressure on the NHS. Those who rely on the NHS will enjoy faster, better care. Independent healthcare capacity will grow rapidly, providing competition and reducing costs. “Patients first. Rapid care. Cutting waste an NHS to be proud of again.” REFORM UK 2024 Thereafter: Put Patients in Charge With a New NHS Voucher Scheme NHS Patients will receive a voucher for private treatment if they can’t see a GP within 3 days. For a consultant it would be 3 weeks. For an operation, 9 weeks. Services will always be free at the point of use. Improve Efficiency. Cut Waste and Unnecessary Managers Operating theatres must be open on weekends. Rotas must be planned further in advance. Nail down better prices using economies of scale. Review all NHS Private Finance Contracts for significant savings potential. Charge those who fail to attend medical appointments without notice. Abolish the NHS Race and Health Observatory. Save A&E Cut waiting times with a campaign of ‘Pharmacy First, GP Second, A&E Last’. We will offer tax incentives for new pharmacies and those who employ more staff to assist in relieving pressure on A&E. Excess Deaths and Vaccine Harms Public Inquiry Excess deaths are nearly as high as they were during the Covid pandemic. Young people are over-represented. NHS PLEDGES COSTS = £17 BILLION PA NET ZERO Net Zero is Crippling our Economy Net Zero is pushing up bills, damaging British industries like steel, and making us less secure. We can protect our environment with more tree planting, more recycling and less single use plastics. New technology will help, but we must not impoverish ourselves in pursuit of unaffordable, unachievable global CO2 targets. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Scrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies Ditching Net Zero could save the public sector over £30 billion per year for the next 25 years. Scrap Annual £10 Billion of Renewable Energy Subsidies Achieve this through equivalent taxes on them. Renewables are not cheaper. Our bills have increased dramatically in line with the huge increase in renewables capacity over the last 15 years. Cheap, Secure Energy for Britain Start fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil. Grant shale gas licences on test sites for 2 years. Enable major production when safety is proven, with local compensation schemes. Thereafter: Cleaner Energy from New Technology Fast-track clean nuclear energy with new Small Modular Reactors, built in Britain. Increase and incentivise ethical UK lithium mining for electric batteries, combined cycle gas turbines, clean synthetic fuel, tidal power and explore clean coal mining. “Reform UK will scrap Net Zero to cut bills and restore growth.” NET ZERO PLEDGES SAVINGS = £30 BILLION PA REFORM UK 2024 POLICING Law and Order Urgently Needs Reform Reform UK will restore Law and Order on Britain’s streets and make sure that criminals face justice. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Commence Increase in Police Numbers Recruitment to increase UK per capita police numbers to 300 per 100k population. That is 40,000 new front-line officers, over a 5-year parliament. Commence Zero Tolerance Policing Clampdown on all crime and antisocial behaviour. Increase Stop and Search substantially. Prison for violent crimes and possessing a knife. Drug dealing and trafficking will get mandatory life imprisonment. A new offence of Substantial Possession of Drugs will meet heavy fines. New Police Leadership and Recruitment Regime Strong preference for ex-military officers and personnel. High standards of fitness and presentation for front line officers. Sack Chief Constables that allow two-tier policing. More Bobbies on the Beat Ensure that police return to the beat and use better technology and stop wasting time on paperwork. Allow PCSOs to become police officers before the role is phased out. Common Sense Policing not ‘Woke’ Policing Scrap all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) roles and regulations to stop two-tier policing. Overhaul the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) so that the police complaints system becomes more accountable and works for the law-abiding public. Thereafter: De-Politicise the College of Policing Prioritise crime prevention, discipline, public service and high standards of strength and fitness among trainees. Replace degree-standard entry with an entrance exam. Require officers to complete a 2-year probationary period. Stricter entry requirements. REFORM UK 2024 9 “Zero tolerance policing. More police, higher standards” POLICING PLEDGES COSTS = £3 BILLION PA JUSTICE Our Justice System Needs Reform Reform UK will build a common sense justice system that punishes criminals and keeps the public safe. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Urgent Sentencing Review with Automatic Life Imprisonment for Violent Repeat Offenders Those committing second violent or serious offences will receive mandatory life sentences. Increase the Criminal Justice Budget The budget is almost the same as it was 10 years ago. Increase it from £10 billion to £12 billion to ensure more high calibre staff to cut delays. Reopen local magistrates’ courts to clear the case backlog. Change the Definition of Hate Crime The CPS and police definition of a hate crime has led to systemic bias. Members of the British public must not be investigated because ‘any’ person ‘perceives’ that a hate crime has been committed. Start Building of 10,000 New Detention Places Start expansion in capacity of state built and managed prisons so that life means life for those who endanger the public. Commission disused military bases if needed. Thereafter: Reform the Child Maintenance Service We will launch a special division of the Family Court for maintenance and defaults. Share parental care 50/50 where appropriate. Rights of access for grandparents. Stop Child Grooming Gangs Deport offenders holding dual citizenship. Make child grooming an aggravating offence. Improve safeguarding of victims and vulnerable. No bail for grooming gang offenders. Tackle Youth Crime Reopen High Intensity Training Camps for young offenders to teach basic education, teamwork and values. REFORM UK 2024 10 “Reform UK will make sure that criminals face justice.” JUSTICE PLEDGES COSTS = £2 BILLION PA EDUCATION Too Many Children and Young People are Being Badly Let Down “Education that nurtures skills, character and values - not a divided society.” EDUCATION PLEDGES COSTS = £5 BILLION PA REFORM UK 2024 11 Reform UK wants an education system that ensures young people are proud of Britain and learn the skills, character and values to succeed in life. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: A Patriotic Curriculum in Primary and Secondary Schools Any teaching about a period or example of British or European imperialism or slavery must be paired with the teaching of a non-European occurrence of the same to ensure balance. History and social science curriculum to be reviewed and audited regularly to ensure balance. Our children must be taught about their heritage. Ban Transgender Ideology in Primary and Secondary Schools No gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. Inform parents of under 16s about their children’s life decisions. Schools must have single sex facilities. Tax relief of 20% on all Independent Education No VAT on Fees. If parents can afford to pay a bit more, we should incentivise them to choose independent schools. This will significantly ease pressure on state schools and improve education for all. Scrap Interest on Student Loans Extend loan capital repayment periods to 45 years. Restrict undergraduate numbers well below current levels, too many courses are not good enough and students are being ripped off. Enforce minimum entry standards. Thereafter: Cut Funding to Universities that Undermine Free Speech The government’s Free Speech Act is toothless. Allowing political bias or cancel culture must face heavy financial penalties. Permanent Exclusions for Violent and Disruptive Students We will double the number of Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) so schools can function safely. We will also ensure that best practice is spread across PRUs. Universities Must Provide 2-Year Undergraduate Courses The option of 2-year courses would reduce student debt and allow earlier entry into employment to help pay it off. BENEFITS The Benefits System is Broken Reform UK will ensure those who can work do work. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Make Work Pay Lifting the Income Tax start point to £20,000 per year means an extra £1,500 per year. This would be a key incentive for those on benefits to find work. Motivate up to 2 million People Back to Work Reforms to benefit support and training will help people back into work. Particular focus on 16-34 year olds. Employment is critical to improving mental health. Tax relief for businesses that undertake apprenticeships. Enforce a 2-Strike Rule for Job Offers All job seekers and those fit to work must find employment within 4 months or accept a job after 2 offers. Otherwise, benefits are withdrawn. Face to Face, Not Remote Assessments for Benefits Personal Independence Payment and Work Capability Assessment should be face to face. We will require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments. Those registered with severe disabilities or serious long-term illnesses would be exempt from regular checks. REFORM UK 2024 12 “In Britain, if you can work, you must work.” BENEFITS PLEDGES SAVINGS = £15 BILLION PA BREXIT Brexit Means Taking Back Control of our Borders, Money and Laws Reform UK will do what the Tories have failed to - grasp the huge opportunities of Brexit CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Legislate to Scrap EU Regulations with Immediate Effect Britain still has over 6,700 retained EU laws, which we will rescind. British laws on State Aid, Competition, Employment, Net Zero and the Environment are still based on EU regulations. Abandon the Windsor Framework This is worse than the original Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK has been partitioned down the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is still in the EU’s single market for goods. It is unacceptable that British citizens in Northern Ireland are being ruled by EU laws. Thereafter: Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces The government has signed up to the EU Horizon programme. That means we send money to the European Defence Fund and part of the EU’s military mobility project. Our Armed Forces are at risk of being sucked into an EU Command and Control Force. Prepare for Renegotiations on the EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement A so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back. REFORM UK 2024 13 “Reform UK will unlock the major opportunities of Brexit.” DEFENCE Britain has some of the Best and Bravest Armed Forces in the World Reform UK will ensure our servicemen and women have the resources they need to defend our nation and that they are respected and supported after they leave the services. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Increase Defence Spending to 2.5% of National GDP by year 3, then 3% within 6 years This will increase the size and capacity of our armed forces and ensure our lead role in NATO. It will also improve equipment, quality of life for services personnel and boost morale in military communities. Introduce Urgent Pay Review Increase basic pay across our armed forces to boost recruitment and retention. It is unacceptable that a private soldier is paid less than an Amazon worker. Introduce new Armed Forces Justice Bill Protect our servicemen and women on active duty inside and outside the UK from civil law and human rights lawyers. The bill will also create an armed forces watchdog to fast-track complaints and appeals in housing and welfare. New, Dedicated Ministerial Department for Veterans A properly funded and resourced whole department is essential to guarantee no veteran goes without and that our former servicemen and women play a leading role in our society and economy. Thereafter: Recruit 30,000 for the army Military national service for 30,000 young people for one year is not the answer. We need to recruit 30,000 to join the army full time Regenerate Britain’s Defence Manufacturing and Technology Introduce incentives and tax breaks to boost the UK defence industry. Improve equipment self-sufficiency and manufacture world class products for export. Reform Defence Procurement Launch a Joint Acquisition Corp to ensure world class procurement. The Ministry of Defence must listen to soldiers on the front line and ensure they get the equipment they need. Education for Military Personnel Free education both during and after service is vital to ensure a successful return to civilian life. “Reform UK will strengthen our armed forces and empower our veterans.” DEFENCE PLEDGES COSTS = £14 BILLION PA REFORM UK 2024 HOUSING Britain has a Housing Crisis Reform UK will ensure that people can own their own home by unleashing housebuilding across the country and cutting immigration. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Review the Planning System Fast-track planning and tax incentives for development of brownfield sites. ‘Loose fit planning’ policy for large residential developments with preapproved guidelines and developer requirements. Reform Social Housing Law Prioritise local people and those who have paid into the system. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front. Scrap section 24 for Landlords The tax system should encourage smaller landlords into the rental markets. Not penalise them. We will restore landlords’ rights to deduct finance costs and mortgage interest from tax on rental income. Abolish the Renters’ (Reform) Bill Existing legislation was inadequate to address bad practices. Instead, we will boost the monitoring, appeals and enforcement process for renters with grievances. Thereafter: Protection for Leaseholders All potential charges for leasehold or freehold residents must be clearly stated and consented to. Enforce Section 106 agreements. Ensure it is cheaper and easier to extend leases to 990 years and buy freeholds. Incentivise Use of New Construction Technology We will incentivise innovation to speed up building: modular construction, digital technology and building sites that improve efficiency and cut waste. REFORM UK 2024 15 “Affordable homes for hard-working British people.” HOUSING PLEDGES COSTS = £ NEUTRAL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Britain has one of the Highest Family Breakdown Rates in the Western World “Putting families first.Britain’s future depends on our young people.” Reform UK believes that strong families are the bedrock of a thriving society – we will support family formation and give parents back control. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Support Marriage Through the Tax System As soon as finances allow, introduce a UK 25% transferable marriage tax allowance. This would mean no tax on the first £25,000 of income for either spouse. This will help make work pay and incentivise people trapped on benefits back into the workplace. Choice for Stay-at-Home Mums or Dads The majority of mothers would choose to stay at home more if they could. Front-loading the Child Benefit system for children aged 1-4 would give parents the choice to spend more time with their children. Mandate Single Sex Spaces Public toilets and changing areas must provide single sex facilities. Promote Child Friendly App Restricted Smartphones Social media is associated with eating disorders, anxiety, depression, suicide and the child mental health crisis. Launch an inquiry into social media harms. Thereafter: Review the Online Safety Bill Social media giants that push baseless transgender ideology and divisive Critical Race theory should have no role in regulating free speech. REFORM UK 2024 16 CHILDREN & FAMILIES PLEDGES COSTS = £8 BILLION PA TRANSPORT & UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE The Scandal of our Crumbling Infrastructure Must End Reform UK will take a pragmatic approach to getting Britain’s infrastructure back on its feet and keeping it secure from foreign threats. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Scrap HS2 Save £25 billion by scrapping the rest of this bloated vanity project. Stop the War on Drivers Legislate to ban ULEZ Clean Air Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. Scrapping Net Zero means no more bans on petrol and diesel cars and no legal requirements for manufacturers to sell electric cars. We will keep the speed limit low where safety is critical. Otherwise, 20 MPH zones will be scrapped. Accelerate Transport Infrastructure Focus on our coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands. Improve existing rail and road links. Integrated services are critical. Thereafter: Tighter Regulation and New Ownership Model for Critical National Infrastructure The British taxpayer needs to be in control of Britain’s utilities. Launch a new model that brings 50% of each utility into public ownership. The other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds, benefiting from new expertise and better management. We will ensure standing charges are capped to help low users and pensioners. A Single Government Infrastructure Funding Stream Overhaul and merge the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure Bank. Scrap Net Zero objectives. Simplify the funding process to save time, cut waste, boost funding and accountability. “Reform UK has the vision to transform Britain’s broken infrastructure.” TRANSPORT AND UTILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE PLEDGES SAVINGS = £25 BILLION ONE-OFF£5 BILLION PER YEAR OVER FIRST 5 YEARS REFORM UK 2024 AGRICULTURE British Farming Needs Reform to Take Advantage of Brexit Reform UK will revitalise Britain’s agriculture to give a much-needed boost to our farmers and guarantee the country’s food security. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Increase the Farming Budget to £3 Billion Focus on smaller farms. Keep farmland in use. Bring young people into farming. Boost rural economy and culture. Increase innovation and diversification. Help farmers to farm, not pay them to leave or retire. Scrap Climate-Related Farming Subsidies Productive land must be farmed, not be used for solar farms or rewilding. Replace current subsidies with direct payments. Stop Natural England from taking action that damages farmers. Protect Country Sports These increase investment and help conservation of our environment. They boost rural jobs, communities and local economies. Thereafter: Stop Supermarket Price Fixing Grant powers to the Competitions and Markets Authority to ensure fair pricing. Help farmers sell their produce directly to the public. Change planning laws to support farm shops with zero business rates. Buy British. Buy Quality Target 70% to ensure food security. Taxpayer funded organisations should source 75% of their food from the UK. Clear labelling for consumer choice. Boost smaller food processors and abattoirs through tax breaks and other incentives. Farming not Form Filling Many farmers spend over 15 hours a week on paperwork. Cut red tape from HMRC and the British Cattle Movement Service. REFORM UK 2024 18 “Reform UK will put British agriculture back on its feet.” AGRICULTURE PLEDGES COSTS = £2 BILLION PA FISHING & COASTAL COMMUNITIES The Government has Betrayed Britain’s Fishing Industry Reform UK will seize the huge opportunity to renew our fishing industry and revive our coastal communities. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Stop EU Fishers Taking UK Quotas End automatic access to UK waters. Every foreign fishing vessel must pay for a licence to gain access to the UK’s 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), as designated under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Stop Foreign Owners using British flags of convenience. Quota reforms needed to help small scale fishing. Expand the Royal Navy Overseas Patrol Squadron Police Britain’s 200 nautical mile EEZ properly. Assess the possibility of creating a dedicated coast guard or fisheries protection agency. Ban Foreign Supertrawlers from UK Waters Extend the ban on pair trawling for bass beyond the South East and 12-mile territorial waters. Ban Dutch vessels from electric pulse fishing in Britain’s 200 mile EEZ. Thereafter: Rebuild UK Fish Processing Tax and other incentives to ensure that all fish caught in British waters are landed and processed in the UK. Fish caught by foreign vessels in UK waters should also be landed and processed here when capacity allows. Revitalise the UK’s Fishing Fleet Tax incentives and vocational training to increase UK fishing fleets. Include fishing communities in policy making. Guarantee Sustainable Stocks Implement a ‘dynamic management system’. Work with national and regional partners such as the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. “Reviving our coastal communities. Revitalising our fishingindustry.” FISHING AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES PLEDGES COSTS = £2 BILLION PA REFORM UK 2024 PENSIONS AND SOCIAL CARE Our Elderly Deserve to be Treated with Dignity and Respect Reform UK will ensure that our elderly people can live with dignity through long-term reforms funded by a growing economy. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Commence Royal Commission of Inquiry into Social Care System A national plan is critical for a sustainable social care system. The sector needs flexibility, tax incentives, VAT breaks and less waste. Simplify social care through a single funding stream, instead of the split between NHS and Local on hundreds of millions of profits through complex offshore property company structures and high interest shareholder loans. This has to end. Thereafter: Review Pension Provision The current pension system is riddled with complexity, huge cost and poor returns leading to less uptake. Countries like Australia do savings and pensions much better and cheaper than we do and from a much younger age. End the Mineworkers Pension Scandal We accept the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee 2021 recommendations in full to amend the Mineworkers Pension Scheme arrangements so that all the REFORM UK 2024 20 “Reform UK will treat our elderly with the respect they deserve.” Authorities.

Immediate end of political appointees. Replace Civil Service leaders with successful professionals from the private sector, who are political appointees, who come and go with the government. Commence Reform of the Postal Voting System Postal voting has allowed electoral fraud. We will stop postal voting except for the elderly, disabled or those who can’t leave their homes. Thereafter: Proportional Representation Voting for the House of Commons Large numbers of voters have no representation in parliament and new parties are shut out of the political system. Voter turnout could be some 10% higher with PR. A referendum is needed. A British Bill of Rights Our freedoms must be codified and guaranteed. Never again can our entire country be locked down on shoddy evidence and lies. Our data and privacy must be protected. Surveillance of the public must be limited and those monitoring us held to account. REFORM UK 2024 21 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PLEDGES = £ NEUTRAL RECLAIMING BRITAIN Reform is Needed to Defend and Promote British Culture, Identity “Upholding British culture, identity, and values.” and Values Reform UK will uphold British values and legislate against extremist forces that seek to undermine our way of life. CRITICAL REFORMS NEEDED IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Reaffirm British Sovereignty Reject the influence of the World Economic Forum. Reject the World Health Organisation (WHO) Pandemic Treaty and cancel our membership of the WHO unless there is fundamental reform to its structure and funding. Reform UK also opposes the Creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). We oppose a cashless society. Replace the 2010 Equalities Act The Equalities Act requires discrimination in the name of ‘positive action’. We will scrap Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity. Propose a Comprehensive Free Speech Bill Legislate to stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology that threatens personal freedom and democracy. No more de-banking, cancel culture, left wing hate mobs or political bias in public institutions. Stop Sharia law being used in the UK. Commence Reform of the BBC The out-of-touch wasteful BBC is institutionally biased. The TV licence is taxation without representation. We will scrap it. In a world of on-demand TV People should be free to choose. Make St George’s and St David’s Day a Public Holiday English national identity should be officially promoted and celebrated, not ignored or banned. Launch an Anti-Corruption Unit for Westminster We will ensure that public officials face sanctions if they break the rules, including prison.
