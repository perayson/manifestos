1 Foreword

This election is our chance to win the change our country desperately needs.

Everywhere I go across our great United Kingdom, I see people from all 
backgrounds and all walks of life, working hard, raising families, helping others and 
playing by the rules. But they have been let down and taken for granted for far too 
long by this out-of-touch Conservative Government. Families and pensioners are 
struggling with sky-high energy bills, food prices and housing costs - and the 
Conservatives have only added to the pain, because they just don't care.

The Conservatives have plunged the NHS into crisis, failing to deliver the new 
hospitals they promised and making people wait hours for an ambulance, weeks to 
see a GP or months for urgent cancer treatment. They are letting water companies 
get away with pumping filthy sewage into our rivers and lakes and onto our 
beaches.

It's time for a change.

These Conservatives have got to go. And in so many parts of the country, we have 
shown that it is the Liberal Democrats who can get them out.

But this election is about more than a change of government. We must transform 
the very nature of British politics itself, so that we can fix the health and care crisis, 
get our economy back on track, end the appalling sewage scandal, and give people 
the fair deal they deserve.

Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to elect a strong local champion who 
will fight for a fair deal for you and your community. A fair deal where everyone can 
afford a decent home somewhere safe and clean - with a comfortable retirement 
when the time comes. A fair deal where every child can go to a good school and 
have real opportunities to fulfil their potential. A fair deal where everyone can get 
the high-quality healthcare they need, when they need it and where they need it.

That is the fair deal the Liberal Democrats are fighting for. I know we can achieve it. 
So join us, and let's make it happen!

2 Our Fair Deal

In so many ways, things in our country are broken. The economy, the National 
Health Service, the climate, the housing market - all are in crisis after years of 
Conservative neglect. Schools are crumbling and clean rivers seem a thing of the 
past. The Conservatives have wrecked our relationship with our nearest neighbours 
in Europe, and our political system is simply not fit for purpose. Millions of people 
feel powerless and excluded.

It doesn't have to be this way. Britain has overcome big challenges before and we 
can do it again now.

For more than 150 years, Liberals and Liberal Democrats have led the fight for a 
fair, free and open society: championing free trade, introducing the state pension 
and free school meals, laying the foundations of the welfare state and the NHS, 
legalising same-sex marriage, and taking urgent action to tackle the climate 
emergency.

Today, our fair deal would give everyone the power to make the most of their 
potential, and real freedom to decide how they live their lives. It would call the 
over-powerful to account. It has five key themes.

1. A fair deal on the economy

Everyone deserves the chance to get on in life, see their hard work properly 
rewarded and realise their hopes for the future. Businesses and entrepreneurs 
should be supported to create worthwhile jobs in every part of the UK.

Liberal Democrats will invest in renewable power and home insulation to 
drive a strong economic recovery, bring down energy bills and create clean, 
secure, well-paid new jobs.

We will put people first, investing in more apprenticeships and new Lifelong Skills 
Grants. We will overhaul parental leave to give families more choice and flexibility 
over how to juggle work and home life. We will support entrepreneurs, back small 
businesses, and reform business rates to help our high streets. We will make Britain 
a world leader in the new infrastructure, businesses and technologies needed to 


<pb/>
tackle climate change. We will manage the public finances with the utmost care and 
responsibility. We will fix the UK's broken relationship with Europe and tear down 
the Conservatives' damaging barriers to trade.

2. A fair deal on public services

Everyone should receive the care they need when they are ill or frail, and a helping 
hand when they fall on tough times. A strong NHS - open to all, regardless of wealth 
- gives people the freedom they need to live their lives as they choose. Every child 
deserves the best possible start in life. We know that education is the best possible 
investment in our country's future.

Liberal Democrats will give everyone a new right to see a GP within seven 
days, or 24 hours if it's urgent, with the extra doctors needed to make it 
happen.

We will invest in improving public health, expanding early access to health services, 
and fixing social care. We will give every child the support they need with more 
specialist teachers, free school meals for all children in poverty, and a dedicated 
mental health professional in every school. We will repair the broken safety net that 
currently consigns so many to poverty. We will restore community policing and 
ensure that every burglary is properly investigated. And we will fund public services 
through fair taxes, such as reversing the Conservatives' tax cuts for big banks.

3. A fair deal on the environment

Everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of our wonderful natural 
environment, and our children should inherit the future they deserve. We must act 
now - locally, nationally and globally. The UK can lead the world with innovation and 
ingenuity, while boosting the economy and enhancing everyone's quality of life.

Liberal Democrats will hold big companies to account by giving them a duty 
to protect the environment, including banning water companies from 
dumping raw sewage into rivers, lakes and coastal areas.


<pb/>
We will put tackling climate change at the heart of a new industrial strategy. We will 
cut emissions and bills with an emergency Home Energy Upgrade programme. We 
will drive a rooftop solar revolution and invest in clean energy, transport and 
industry. We will restore nature and tackle toxic air pollution. And we will provide 
skills training, incentives and advice to help families and businesses with the 
transition to net zero.

4. A strong United Kingdom and a fair international order

Liberal Democrats are proud internationalists. We believe that our country and our 
people thrive when we are open and outward-looking. The UK can be an incredible 
force for good when it stands tall on the world stage, and both the Covid pandemic 
and Vladimir Putin's illegal war in Ukraine show that events beyond Britain's borders 
inevitably become our concern.

Liberal Democrats will immediately fix our broken relationship with Europe, 
forge a new partnership built on cooperation, not confrontation, and move to 
conclude a new comprehensive agreement that removes as many barriers to 
trade as possible.

We will stand up to authoritarianism by championing the liberal, rules-based 
international order. We will reverse the Conservatives' damaging cuts to the Army 
and international development. We will work across borders to provide safe and 
legal routes to sanctuary for refugees and tackle common threats such as human 
trafficking, cybercrime and terrorism.

5. A truly fair democracy

Every person matters. Liberal Democrats believe that basic rights and dignity are 
the birthright of every individual, to be respected, cherished and enhanced. 
Everyone should have equal power in our democracy, and be able to hold all 
Members of Parliament properly to account.

Liberal Democrats will introduce proportional representation for electing 
MPs, and local councillors in England, and cap donations to political parties.


<pb/>
We will shift power out of the centre in Westminster and Whitehall, so local 
decisions are made by and for the people and communities they affect. We will 
demand higher standards of behaviour from Government Ministers by enshrining 
the Ministerial Code in law. We will champion the UK's Human Rights Act and resist 
any attempts to weaken or repeal it.

Our goal is to transform the nature of British politics itself - to make it relevant, 
engaging and responsive to people's needs and dreams.


<pb/>
3 The Economy

Liberal Democrats will build a strong, fair economy that benefits everyone in the 
UK, by helping people back to work, supporting small businesses, improving 
long-term productivity, and delivering much greater stability for long-term 
investment, especially for the industries of the future.

Core to our economic policy for improving stability and growth will be responsible 
management of the public finances, fixing the broken trading relationship with 
Europe, and an industrial strategy focused on the skills the future UK economy will 
need, from the renewables industry to the digital and bioscience sectors.

The Conservatives have badly mismanaged the economy and recklessly damaged 
the public finances, grinding economic growth to a halt and adding billions to the 
cost of servicing our debt. Their botched Brexit deal has badly damaged the 
economy, leaving everyone worse off. By abandoning climate commitments, they 
have undermined industry's confidence in investment in the green products and 
technologies vital to both economic recovery and tackling the climate emergency.

And they have taken people for granted, failing to deliver the investment needed 
to bring prosperity to all nations and regions of the UK. They left families and 
businesses to suffer the effects of their cost-of-living crisis without enough 
support, hit people with years of unfair tax rises, such as the freeze on income tax 
thresholds, and their promises to 'level up' have proved hollow.

We will empower people and support businesses to thrive by encouraging 
investment and boosting productivity.

We will:

l Provide long-term help with the cost of living by cutting energy bills 
through an emergency Home Energy Upgrade programme, tackling rising 
food prices through a National Food Strategy, and getting mortgage rates 
under control through careful economic management.


<pb/>
&bullet; Invest in green infrastructure, innovation and skills to boost economic 
growth and create good jobs and prosperity in every nation and region of 
the UK, while tackling the climate crisis.

&bullet; Repair the broken relationship with Europe, which acts as a brake on the 
economy and costs the UK investment, jobs and tax revenue.

&bullet; Foster stability, certainty and confidence by managing the public finances 
responsibly to get the national debt falling as a share of the economy and 
ensure that day-to-day spending does not exceed the amount raised in 
taxes, while making the investments our country needs.

&bullet; Put an end to Conservative waste and give taxpayers real value for money, 
giving HMRC the resources it needs to properly tackle tax avoidance and 
evasion.

&bullet; Implement a tax policy that recognises how high the Conservatives have 
raised personal taxes, making the cost-of-living crisis worse, by instead 
focusing tax changes on reversing the Conservatives' tax cuts for big banks 
and imposing a proper, one-off windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and 
gas producers and traders.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Create good jobs and prosperity in every nation and region of the UK by:

&bullet; Launching an ambitious industrial strategy to incentivise businesses to invest 
and create good jobs across the UK, as set out in chapter 4.

&bullet; Continuing to champion investment in the Northern Powerhouse, Western 
Gateway and Midlands Engine.

&bullet; Supporting local and regional economic partnerships to coordinate 
development projects and boost growth in their areas.

&bullet; Working with the devolved administrations to develop joint policies and 
partnerships to boost growth across the whole UK.

&bullet; Ensuring that gigabit broadband is available to every home and business, 
including in rural and remote communities, as set out in chapter 15.


<pb/>
&bullet; Foster the stability, certainty and confidence that are vital for economic growth 
and investment by:

&bullet; Protecting the independence of the Bank of England and keeping the inflation 
target of 2%.

&bullet; Ensuring that all fiscal events are accompanied by independent forecasts from 
the Office for Budget Responsibility.

&bullet; Increase investment in green infrastructure, including renewable energy and 
zero-carbon transport, industry and housing, as set out in chapters 4, 5, 14 and 
16, and give a clearer zero-carbon remit to the UK Infrastructure Bank.

&bullet; Remain committed to delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals in the UK and around the world.

&bullet; Work with partners in international forums, including the OECD and the UN, to 
tackle international corporate tax avoidance for the benefit of all countries and 
make the case for increasing the global minimum rate of corporation tax to 21%.

&bullet; Our priority for tax cuts, when the public finances allow, will be to cut income tax 
by raising the tax-free personal allowance, benefitting the vast majority of 
families and taking more low-paid workers out of paying income tax altogether.

&bullet; Make the tax system fairer and raise the money needed for our investment 
plans by:

&bullet; Reversing Conservative tax cuts for the big banks, restoring Bank Surcharge 
and Bank Levy revenues to 2016 levels in real terms.

&bullet; Increasing the Digital Services Tax on social media firms and other tech giants 
from 2% to 6%.

&bullet; Fairly reforming capital gains tax to close loopholes exploited by the super 
wealthy.

&bullet; Introducing a 4% tax on the share buyback schemes of FTSE-100 listed 
companies, to incentivise productive investment, job creation and economic 
growth.

&bullet; End retrospective tax changes such as the loan charge brought in by the 
Conservatives, and review the Government's off-payroll working IR35 reforms to 
ensure self-employed people are treated fairly.


<pb/>
&bullet; Expand the British Business Bank to perform a more central role in the 
economy, to ensure that viable small and medium-sized businesses have access 
to capital, and enable it to help 'crowd-in' private investment, in particular in 
zero-carbon products and technologies.

&bullet; Empower consumers and ensure that everyone can enjoy the benefits of new 
technology, by setting a UK-wide target for digital literacy and requiring all 
products to provide a short, clear version of their terms and conditions, setting 
out the key facts as they relate to individuals' data and privacy.

&bullet; Introduce a national financial inclusion strategy and require both the Financial 
Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority to have regard to 
financial inclusion, such as protecting access to cash, especially in remote areas, 
supporting banking hubs, expanding access to bank accounts, delivering 
Sharia-compliant student finance and supporting vulnerable consumers.


<pb/>
4 Business and Jobs

We aim to make Britain one of the most attractive places in the world for 
businesses to invest. Only in partnership with responsible, sustainable businesses 
can we tackle the cost-of-living and climate crises, and create the wealth to invest 
in healthcare, education and other essential public services.

Private enterprise is the principal engine of growth and prosperity in the UK. We 
will support it by creating a stable business environment with smart regulation and 
investing in skills, infrastructure, research and innovation. In return, we expect 
businesses to commit to promote skills, equality and good governance, and to 
support their local communities.

The Conservative Government has failed businesses and workers. Growth is 
minimal, productivity is slipping, and constant U-turns have badly damaged 
business confidence. Unfair tax hikes have further dented our prosperity, and our 
town centres and high streets are crying out for a fair business rates system.

The Conservatives' botched deal with Europe has done enormous damage to 
British businesses, putting up new barriers to trade and creating reams of red 
tape. The UK has less clout in trade negotiations, the US is not interested, and the 
new trade deals the Conservatives have signed will undercut high environmental 
standards and hurt our farmers.

We will work in partnership with business to offer stability and ensure that we 
maximise the opportunities for investment, growth and employment across the 
country. We will make the UK a world leader in ethical, inclusive new technology, 
including artificial intelligence, and a global centre for the development, 
manufacture and export of clean technologies. And we will prioritise the depth 
and quality of trade deals, ensuring they deliver benefits for the whole country.

We will:

&bullet; Develop an industrial strategy that will give businesses certainty and 
incentivise them to invest in new technologies to grow the economy, 
create good jobs and tackle the climate crisis.


<pb/>
&bullet; Unlock British businesses' global potential by bringing down trade barriers 
and building stronger future relationships with our closest trading 
partners, including by fixing our broken relationship with Europe as set 
out in chapter 22.

&bullet; Fix the skills and recruitment crisis by investing in education and training, 
including increasing the availability of apprenticeships and career advice 
for young people.

&bullet; Boost productivity and empower more people to enter the job market 
- such as parents, carers and disabled people - by making the most of 
technology and new ways of working.

&bullet; Boost small businesses and empower them to create new local jobs, 
including by abolishing business rates and replacing them with a 
Commercial Landowner Levy to help our high streets.

&bullet; Introduce a general duty of care for the environment and human rights in 
business operations and supply chains.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Re-establish the Industrial Strategy Council and put it on a statutory footing, to 
ensure vital oversight, monitoring and evaluation of the industrial strategy for 
the long term.

&bullet; Support British industry to cut emissions while holding businesses to account 
for their role in tackling climate change, as set out in chapter 5.

&bullet; Support science, research and innovation, particularly among small businesses 
and startups, in universities and in zero-carbon, environmental and medical 
technologies, including by:

&bullet; Continuing to participate in Horizon Europe and joining the European 
Innovation Council.

&bullet; Aiming for at least 3% of GDP to be invested in research and development by 
2030, rising to 3.5% by 2034.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ensure the UK has the highest possible standards of environmental, health, 
labour and consumer protection, at least matching EU standards.

&bullet; Tackle the productivity crisis by encouraging businesses to invest in training, take 
up digital technologies and become more energy efficient, including through our 
industrial strategy and reform of business rates.

&bullet; Work with the major banks to fund the creation of a local banking sector 
dedicated to meeting the needs of local small and medium-sized businesses.

&bullet; Power scale-up companies, especially outside of London and the South East, 
using innovative ways of 'crowding-in' private sector investment.

&bullet; Create a clear, workable and well-resourced cross-sectoral regulatory framework 
for artificial intelligence that:

&bullet; Promotes innovation while creating certainty for AI users, developers and 
investors.

&bullet; Establishes transparency and accountability for AI systems in the public sector.

&bullet; Ensures the use of personal data and AI is unbiased, transparent and 
accurate, and respects the privacy of innocent people.

&bullet; Negotiate the UK's participation in the Trade and Technology Council with the US 
and the EU, so we can play a leading role in global AI regulation, and work with 
international partners in agreeing common standards for AI risk and impact 
assessment, testing, monitoring and audit.

&bullet; Unlock British businesses' global potential, bring down trade barriers and use 
UK trade policy as a force for good by:

&bullet; Giving Parliament real power in setting UK trade policy, by ensuring it is 
properly consulted on and signs off on negotiating mandates and any 
completed international trade agreements.

&bullet; Ensuring that all information small and medium-sized enterprises need on 
trade is readily available from a single point of contact, with tailored support 
for those who need it.

&bullet; Making it a clear objective of trade ministers to boost trade by small British 
businesses.


<pb/>
&bullet; Placing human rights, labour and environmental standards and protection at 
the heart of international trade deals.

&bullet; Support our world-renowned whisky industry by reviewing the UK excise duty 
structure to better support whisky exports.

&bullet; Cut resource use, waste and pollution by accelerating the transition to a more 
circular economy that maximises the recovery, reuse, recycling and 
remanufacturing of products. This will cut costs for consumers and businesses, 
reduce exposure to volatile commodity prices, protect the environment and 
create new jobs and enterprises.

&bullet; Promote a public benefit company model for monopoly utility companies.

&bullet; Encourage employers to promote employee ownership by giving staff in listed 
companies with more than 250 employees a right to request shares, to be held 
in trust for the benefit of employees.

&bullet; Reform fiduciary duty and company purpose rules to ensure that all large 
companies have a formal statement of corporate purpose, including 
considerations such as employee welfare, environmental standards, community 
benefit and ethical practice, alongside benefit to shareholders, and that they 
report formally on the wider impact of the business on society and the 
environment.

&bullet; Extend the scope of the existing 'public interest' test when considering approvals 
for takeovers of large or strategically significant companies by overseas-based 
owners to recognise the benefits to the UK economy, workers and consumers of 
protecting UK companies from speculative or short-term interests.

&bullet; Tackle the late payments crisis by requiring all government agencies and 
contractors and companies with more than 250 employees to sign up to the 
prompt payment code, making it enforceable.

&bullet; Invest in people's skills by:

&bullet; Replacing the broken apprenticeship levy with a broader and more flexible 
skills and training levy.


<pb/>
&bullet; Boosting the take-up of apprenticeships, including by guaranteeing they are 
paid at least the National Minimum Wage by scrapping the lower apprentice 
rate.

&bullet; Creating new Lifelong Skills Grants for adults to spend on education and 
training throughout their lives, as set out in chapter 8.

&bullet; Developing National Colleges as national centres of expertise for key sectors, 
such as renewable energy, to deliver the high-level vocational skills that 
businesses need.

&bullet; Identifying and seeking to solve skills gaps, such as the lack of advanced 
technicians, by expanding higher vocational training like foundation degrees, 
Higher National Diplomas, Higher National Certificates and Higher 
Apprenticeships.

&bullet; Improving the quality of vocational education, and strengthening careers advice 
and links with employers in schools and colleges, as set out in chapter 8.

&bullet; Fix the work visa system and expand the Youth Mobility Scheme, as set out in 
chapter 18, to help address the labour shortages that are an outcome of the 
Conservatives' botched deal with Europe.

&bullet; Establish a powerful new Worker Protection Enforcement Authority unifying 
responsibilities currently spread across three agencies - including enforcing the 
minimum wage, tackling modern slavery and protecting agency workers.

&bullet; Establish an independent review to recommend a genuine living wage across all 
sectors, with government departments and all other public sector employers 
taking a leading role in paying it.

&bullet; Modernise employment rights to make them fit for the age of the 'gig economy', 
including by:

&bullet; Establishing a new 'dependent contractor' employment status in between 
employment and self-employment, with entitlements to basic rights such as 
minimum earnings levels, sick pay and holiday entitlement.

&bullet; Reviewing the tax and National Insurance status of employees, dependent 
contractors and freelancers to ensure fair and comparable treatment.

&bullet; Setting a 20% higher minimum wage for people on zero-hour contracts at 
times of normal demand to compensate them for the uncertainty of 
fluctuating hours of work.


<pb/>
&bullet; Giving a right to request a fixed-hours contract after 12 months for 'zero 
hours' and agency workers, not to be unreasonably refused.

&bullet; Reviewing rules concerning pensions so that those in the gig economy don't 
lose out, and portability between roles is protected.

&bullet; Shifting the burden of proof in employment tribunals regarding employment 
status from individual to employer.

&bullet; Making payments available from the first day of missing work rather than the 
fourth.

&bullet; Supporting small employers with Statutory Sick Pay costs, consulting with 
them on the best way to do this.


<pb/>
5 Climate Change and Energy

Climate change is an existential threat. Soaring temperatures leading to wildfires, 
floods, droughts and rising sea levels are affecting millions of people directly, and 
billions more through falling food production and rising prices. Urgent action is 
needed - in the UK and around the world - to achieve net zero and avert 
catastrophe.

At the same time, sky-high energy bills are hurting families and businesses, fuelling 
the cost-of-living crisis. Russia's assault on Ukraine has reinforced the need to 
significantly reduce the UK's dependence on fossil fuels and invest in renewables 
- both to cut energy bills and to deliver energy security.

The Conservative Government has failed to act with anything close to the speed or 
ambition these challenges demand. The independent Climate Change Committee 
warns that the Government is not on track to meet its legally binding targets.

Liberal Democrats are committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero 
by 2045 at the latest.

We will take the bold, urgent action needed to tackle climate change, cut energy 
bills and create hundreds of thousands of secure, well-paid new jobs. Together 
with innovative British businesses, we will make the UK the world leader in the 
clean technologies of the future. We will help households meet the cost of the 
transition to net zero and make sure everyone benefits from it, leaving no one 
behind.

We will:

&bullet; Make homes warmer and cheaper to heat with a ten-year emergency 
upgrade programme, starting with free insulation and heat pumps for 
those on low incomes, and ensure that all new homes are zero-carbon.

&bullet; Drive a rooftop solar revolution by expanding incentives for households to 
install solar panels, including a guaranteed fair price for electricity sold 
back into the grid.


<pb/>
&bullet; Invest in renewable power so that 90% of the UK's electricity is generated 
from renewables by 2030.

&bullet; Appoint a Chief Secretary for Sustainability in the Treasury to ensure that 
the economy is sustainable, resource-efficient and zero-carbon, establish a 
new Net Zero Delivery Authority to coordinate action across government 
departments and work with devolved administrations, and hand more 
powers and resources to local councils for local net zero strategies.

&bullet; Establish national and local citizens' assemblies to give people real 
involvement in the decisions needed to tackle climate change.

&bullet; Restore the UK's role as a global leader on climate change, by returning 
international development spending to 0.7% of national income, with 
tackling climate change a key priority for development spending.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Take the action needed now to achieve net zero by 2045, including:

&bullet; Meeting the UK's commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions 
by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030.

&bullet; Requiring the National Infrastructure Commission to take fully into account the 
environmental implications of all national infrastructure decisions.

&bullet; Putting tackling climate change at the heart of a new industrial strategy, as set 
out in chapter 4.

&bullet; Investing in education and training to equip people with the skills needed for 
the low-carbon economy of the future, as set out in chapters 4 and 8.

&bullet; Ensuring that nature-based solutions, including tree planting, form a critical 
part of the UK's strategy to tackle climate change, as set out in chapter 12.

&bullet; Putting our farming and food system on an environmentally sustainable 
footing, as set out in chapter 13.

&bullet; Making it cheaper and easier to switch to electric vehicles, restoring the 
requirement that every new car and small van sold from 2030 is zero-
emission, investing in active travel and public transport, electrifying Britain's 
railways, and reducing the climate impact of flying, as set out in chapter 16.

&bullet; Coordinating action across the UK by creating a Joint Climate Council of the 
Nations, as set out in chapter 20.


<pb/>
&bullet; Cut energy bills and emissions, and end fuel poverty, by:

&bullet; Launching an emergency Home Energy Upgrade programme, with free 
insulation and heat pumps for low-income households and a central role for 
local authorities in delivering this programme.

&bullet; Providing incentives for installing heat pumps that cover the real costs.

&bullet; Immediately requiring all new homes and non-domestic buildings to be built 
to a zero-carbon standard, including being fitted with solar panels, and 
progressively increasing standards as technology improves.

&bullet; Reintroducing requirements for landlords to upgrade the energy efficiency of 
their properties to EPC C or above by 2028.

&bullet; Introducing a new subsidised Energy-Saving Homes scheme, with pilots to find 
the most effective combination of tax incentives, loans and grants, together 
with advice and support.

&bullet; Introducing a social tariff for the most vulnerable to provide targeted energy 
discounts for vulnerable households.

&bullet; Helping people with the cost of living and their energy bills by implementing a 
proper, one-off windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and gas producers and 
traders.

&bullet; Decoupling electricity prices from the wholesale gas price.

&bullet; Eliminating unfair regional differences in domestic energy bills.

&bullet; Accelerate the deployment of renewable power and deliver energy security by:

&bullet; Removing the Conservatives' unnecessary restrictions on new solar and wind 
power, and supporting investment and innovation in tidal and wave power in 
particular.

&bullet; Maintaining the ban on fracking and introducing a ban on new coal mines.

&bullet; Building the grid infrastructure required, facilitated by a strategic Land and Sea 
Use Framework as set out in chapter 15.

&bullet; Implementing the UK's G7 pledge to end fossil fuel subsidies, while ensuring a 
just transition that values the skills and experience of people working in the oil 
and gas industry and provides good opportunities for them, and takes special 
care of the regions and communities most affected.

&bullet; Investing in energy storage, including green hydrogen, pumped storage and 
battery capability.

6 Health

Good health gives people the freedom to live their lives as they choose. A thriving 
economy needs a healthy population. Universal high-quality healthcare, free at the 
point of use and accessible wherever and whenever it's needed, is therefore 
essential for both individual freedom and national prosperity.

Our NHS used to be the envy of the world. But now, too many people can't access 
the care they need. The Conservatives have plunged the NHS into crisis - as have 
the SNP in Scotland and Labour in Wales. With more than a hundred thousand 
staff vacancies in England alone, a crisis in staff retention, long waiting times, 
missed targets and poor outcomes, patient safety is being pushed into the danger 
zone.

Getting an appointment with a GP can take weeks and seeing an NHS dentist is 
almost impossible. People are no longer confident that when they ring 999 an 
ambulance will turn up in time. Millions are waiting for treatment, unable to work. 
The frontline workers who were rightly applauded are now overworked and burnt 
out.

Liberal Democrats believe that people should be in control of their own lives and 
health and that means everyone should get the care they need, when they need it, 
where they need it. Instead of just spending money firefighting crisis after crisis, 
we will invest now to save taxpayers' money in the long-run. We will strengthen 
patients' rights, fix crumbling hospitals, recruit and retain a workforce for the 
future, invest in technology that improves outcomes and saves money, and 
restore the UK as a world leader in health research.

Our plan will tackle the crisis at both the front door and the back door to the NHS: 
investing in public health and early access to community services, including GPs, 
pharmacists and dentists, so fewer people need to go to hospital in the first place, 
and fixing the crisis in social care to stop so many people being stuck in hospital 
beds. Liberal Democrats understand that we need to fix social care to save our 
NHS.

We will:

&bullet; Give everyone the right to see a GP within seven days, or within 24 hours if 
they urgently need to, with 8,000 more GPs to deliver on it.

emergency care, ending DIY dentistry and 'dental deserts'.

7 Care

Everyone deserves high-quality care when they need it. Liberal Democrats want 
everyone to be able to live independently and with dignity, and receive any care 
they need in their own home wherever possible.

Carers - paid and unpaid, young and old - do a remarkable and important job. 
They deserve far more support, but are too often forgotten and ignored. 

But social care services in this country are in crisis. Hundreds of thousands of 
people are waiting for care. Many are stranded in hospital beds because the care 
isn't in place for them to leave, putting even more strain on the NHS.

The Conservatives promised to "fix" the crisis in our social care system, that no one 
would have to sell their house to pay for personal care costs, and that they would 
not raise taxes to do it. They have broken all these promises.

We will empower care users, and support care workers and the millions of unpaid 
carers looking after loved ones. We will forge a new consensus on funding to 
ensure that no one has to sell their home to pay for their personal care. We will 
invest to save, recognising that providing care reduces demand on more 
expensive NHS services.

We will:

&bullet; Introduce free personal care based on the model introduced by the Liberal 
Democrats in government in Scotland in 2002, so that provision is based 
on need, not ability to pay.

&bullet; Create a social care workforce plan, establish a Royal College of Care 
Workers to improve recognition and career progression, and introduce a 
higher Carer's Minimum Wage.

&bullet; Establish a cross-party commission to forge a long-term agreement on 
sustainable funding for social care.

need, including paid carer's leave and a statutory guarantee of regular 
respite breaks.

&bullet; Develop a digital strategy to enable care users to live tech-enabled lives.

&bullet; Provide truly personalised care that empowers individuals by:

&bullet; Trialling personal health and social care budgets so that individuals are in 
control of what care they receive.

&bullet; Rolling out digital platforms for care users to develop networks, relationships 
and opportunities, connecting with care workers, friends and family, voluntary 
groups and more.

&bullet; Improving communication standards so carers can support care users to 
co-produce and monitor care plans.

&bullet; Establishing an Independent Living Taskforce to help people live

care for everyone who needs it by:

&bullet; Increasing Carer's Allowance and expanding eligibility for it, as set out in 
chapter 10.

requiring employers to make reasonable adjustments to enable employees 
with caring responsibilities to provide that care.

&bullet; Introducing a Young Carers Pupil Premium as part of an 'Education Guarantee' 
for young carers.

&bullet; Make careers in social care more attractive and value experienced staff to 
improve retention by:

&bullet; Creating a new Carer's Minimum Wage, boosting the minimum wage for care 
workers by &pound;2 an hour, as a starting point for improved pay across the sector.

&bullet; Creating clear career pathways, linked to recommended pay scales, which put 
an end to the undervaluing of skills in the sector.

&bullet; Creating a career ladder to allow flexibility to work across the NHS and social 
care, allowing staff to gain experience in both.

&bullet; Creating a Royal College of Care Workers to represent this skilled workforce.

&bullet; Expanding the NHS Digital Staff Passport to include the care sector.

&bullet; Recruit more staff to the sector with a social care workforce plan, akin to the 
NHS England workforce plan, that includes ethical international recruitment.

&bullet; Support people to age well by:

&bullet; Establishing a Commissioner for Older People and Ageing.

&bullet; Rolling out active ageing programmes and trips and falls assessments for 
everyone over the age of 75 to prevent falls, avoid unnecessary hospital 
admissions and promote healthy ageing.

&bullet; Opening fracture liaison services so that osteoporosis patients can get the 
treatment they need and prevent long-term issues and costs.

strengthen the rights of people who are in or have been in care.

&bullet; Refresh the national strategy for loneliness collaboratively with service providers

dedicated Minister for Tackling Loneliness.


<pb/>
8 Education

Liberal Democrats believe that education is the best investment we can make in 
our children's potential and our country's future.

The Conservatives have consistently let down children and parents and neglected 
schools and colleges. They have failed to grasp the scale of the damage that the 
Covid pandemic has done to children's learning and mental health.

We will invest in education, starting in the crucial early years and continuing 
throughout adulthood. We want every child to get the support and attention they 
need at school, so they leave with the skills, confidence and resilience to be happy 
and successful - whatever they choose to do next.

We will:

&bullet; Put a dedicated, qualified mental health professional in every primary and 
secondary school, making sure all children and parents have someone 
they can turn to for help, funded by increasing the Digital Services Tax on 
social media firms and other tech giants.

&bullet; Increase school and college funding per pupil above the rate of inflation 
every year, and end the scandal of crumbling school and college buildings 
by investing in new buildings and clearing the backlog of repairs.

&bullet; Introduce a 'Tutoring Guarantee' for every disadvantaged pupil who needs 
extra support.

&bullet; Invest in high-quality early years education and close the attainment gap 
by giving disadvantaged children aged three and four an extra five free 
hours a week and tripling the Early Years Pupil Premium to &pound;1,000 a year.

&bullet; Reinstate maintenance grants for disadvantaged students immediately to 
make sure that living costs are not a barrier to studying at university.


<pb/>
&bullet; Create new Lifelong Skills Grants, giving all adults &pound;5,000 to spend on 
education and training throughout their lives, and aim to increase them to 
&pound;10,000 in the future when the public finances allow.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Tackle the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention by:

&bullet; Creating a teacher workforce strategy to ensure that every secondary school 
child is taught by a specialist teacher in their subject.

&bullet; Reforming the School Teachers' Review Body to make it properly independent 
of government and able to recommend fair pay rises for teachers, and fully 
funding those rises every year.

&bullet; Funding teacher training properly so that all trainee posts in school are paid.

&bullet; Introducing a clear and properly funded programme of high-quality 
professional development for all teachers, including training on effective 
parental engagement.

&bullet; Urgently establish a standing commission to build a long-term consensus across 
parties and teachers to broaden the curriculum and make qualifications at 16 
and 18 fit for the 21st century. This will draw on best practice such as the 
International Baccalaureate and ensure children learn core skills such as critical 
thinking, verbal reasoning and creativity.

&bullet; Improve the quality of vocational education, including skills for entrepreneurship 
and self-employment.

&bullet; Strengthen careers advice and links with employers in schools and colleges.

&bullet; Include arts subjects in the English Baccalaureate and give power to Ofsted to 
monitor the curriculum so that schools continue to provide a rich curriculum 
including subjects like art, music or drama.

&bullet; Expand provision of extracurricular activities, such as sport, music, drama, 
debating and coding, starting with a new free entitlement for disadvantaged 
children.


<pb/>
&bullet; Reform Ofsted inspections and end single-word judgements so that parents get 
a clear picture of the true strengths and weaknesses of each school, and schools 
get the guidance and support they need to improve.

&bullet; Implement a new parental engagement strategy, including a regular, published 
parent survey and guidance for schools on providing accessible information to 
parents on what their children are learning.

&bullet; Tackle persistent absence by setting up a register of children who are not in 
school, and working to understand and remove underlying barriers to 
attendance.

&bullet; Tackle the crisis in special educational needs provision, and help to end the 
postcode lottery in provision, by:

&bullet; Giving local authorities extra funding to reduce the amount that schools pay 
towards the cost of a child's Education, Health and Care Plan.

&bullet; Establishing a new National Body for SEND to fund support for children with 
very high needs.

admissions, and SEND functions.

&bullet; Redirect capital funding for unnecessary new free schools to help clear the 
backlog of school repairs.

&bullet; Tackle bullying in schools by promoting pastoral leadership in schools and 
delivering high-quality relationships and sex education.

free hours of early years education a week, as another step towards a universal, 
full-time entitlement for all two- to four-year-olds.

Innovation Council, as set out in chapter 4.

&bullet; Giving higher education institutions a statutory duty of care for their students.

&bullet; Introducing a statutory Student Mental Health Charter and requiring 
universities to make mental health services accessible to their students.

out in chapter 9.

&bullet; Establishing a review of higher education finance in the next Parliament to 
consider any necessary reforms in the light of the latest evidence of the 
impact of the existing financing system on access, participation and quality, 
and make sure there are no more retrospective raising of rates or selling-off of 
loans to private companies.

&bullet; Reporting international student flows separately to estimates of long-term 
migration.

&bullet; Ensuring that all universities work to widen participation by disadvantaged and 
underrepresented groups across the sector, prioritising their work with 
students in schools and colleges, and requiring every university to be 
transparent about selection criteria.


<pb/>
9 Families, Children and 
Young People

Every child deserves the best possible start in life and the opportunity to flourish, 
no matter their background or personal circumstances. Protecting their rights and 
wellbeing as children and ensuring they are properly nourished are top priorities.

Families come in all shapes and sizes, and parents should have the support and 
flexibility to juggle work with parenting as they see fit.

Flexible, affordable childcare and early years education is a critical part of our 
economic infrastructure and helps close the attainment gap between rich and 
poor. It gives parents more choice over how to organise their lives and helps them 
return to work if they want to. Lack of access to affordable childcare is a key driver 
of the gender pay gap.

But affordable childcare is only part of the picture. We will also overhaul parental 
leave to give parents a genuine choice over how to manage things in the first 
months of their child's life.

We will:

&bullet; Extend free school meals to all children in poverty, with an ambition to 
extend them to all primary school children when the public finances allow.

&bullet; Appoint a Cabinet Minister for Children and Young People.

&bullet; Give parents genuine flexibility and choice in the crucial early months by 
doubling Statutory Maternity and Shared Parental Pay to &pound;350 a week and 
introducing an extra use-it-or-lose-it month for fathers and partners, paid 
at 90% of earnings.

&bullet; Make all parental pay and leave day-one rights, and extend them to 
self-employed parents.


<pb/>
&bullet; Expand opportunities for young people to study, teach and volunteer 
abroad by returning to the Erasmus Plus programme as an associated 
country.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Protect and support the rights and wellbeing of every child by:

&bullet; Incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into UK law.

&bullet; Setting up an independent advocacy body for children's safety online.

&bullet; Addressing the underfunding and neglect of children's mental health services, 
youth services and youth justice services.

&bullet; Tackling child poverty, as set out in chapter 10.

&bullet; Giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote, as set out in chapter 20.

&bullet; Ensure that all parents can access childcare that is flexible, affordable and 
fair by:

&bullet; Reviewing the rates paid to providers for free hours to ensure they cover the 
actual costs of delivering high-quality childcare and early years education.

&bullet; Developing a career strategy for nursery staff, including a training programme 
with the majority of those working with children aged two to four to have a 
relevant Early Years qualification or be working towards one.

&bullet; Including a specific emphasis on identifying and supporting children with 
special educational needs and disabilities in the new training programme for 
early years staff.

&bullet; Restore childminding as a valued part of the early years system by:

&bullet; Replacing the three different current registration processes with a single 
childcare register.

&bullet; Commissioning a practitioner-led review to simplify regulation, reduce

&bullet; Fully review and reform the Child Maintenance Service to ensure it works for all 
children and parents, including removing the Collect and Pay charge for 
receiving parents and ensuring that payments cannot be used as a form of 
coercive control over domestic abuse survivors.

10 Pensions and Safety Net

The cost-of-living crisis has caused huge financial hardship across the country and 
restricted the life chances of millions. The Government response has been a series 
of patchy and short-term fixes.

Liberal Democrats believe that no one should fear for their future, struggle to put 
food on the table, or worry about heating their home.

Our aim is to make the UK the best place in the world to work, raise children and 
enjoy retirement by ensuring that proper support is in place for those who need it.

We will:

&bullet; Tackle child poverty by removing the two-child limit and the benefit cap.

&bullet; Set a target of ending deep poverty within a decade, and establish an 
independent commission to recommend further annual increases in 
Universal Credit to ensure that support covers life's essentials, such as 
food and bills.

&bullet; Support pensioners by protecting the triple lock so that pensions always 
rise in line with inflation, wages or 2.5% - whichever is highest.

&bullet; Ensure that women born in the 1950s are finally treated fairly and 
properly compensated.

&bullet; Give unpaid carers the support they deserve by increasing Carer's 
Allowance and expanding it to more carers, and stop pursuing carers for 
old overpayments of Carer's Allowance.


<pb/>
In addition, we will:

&bullet; Repair the broken benefits safety net by:

&bullet; Reducing the wait for the first payment of Universal Credit from five weeks to 
five days.

&bullet; Scrapping the bedroom tax.

&bullet; Replacing the sanctions regime with an incentive-based scheme to help 
people into work.

&bullet; Raising the amount carers can earn and introducing an earnings taper to end 
the unfair cliff-edge.

&bullet; Reducing the number of hours' care per week required.

&bullet; Extending it to carers in full-time education.

&bullet; Developing measures to end the gender pension gap in private pensions and 
ensure working-age carers can save properly for retirement.

&bullet; Improving the State Pension system by investing in helplines to ensure quicker 
responses to queries and resolution of underpayments.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ending the scandal of lost top-up payments by overhauling the processing 
system and providing proper receipts.

&bullet; Fix the broken Statutory Sick Pay system, as set out in chapter 4.

&bullet; Require pension funds and managers to show that their portfolio investments 
are consistent with the Paris Agreement, as set out in chapter 5.

&bullet; Ensure that military compensation for illness or injury does not count towards 
means testing for benefits, as set out in chapter 21.


<pb/>
11 Crime and Policing

Everyone deserves to feel safe in their own homes and communities. But for too 
many people in the UK, that's simply not the reality today.

The Conservatives have talked tough on crime, but failed even to get the basics 
right. Their unnecessary cuts and ineffective use of resources have contributed to 
the rise in unsolved crimes as police forces are left overstretched and under-
resourced.

Serious violence is destroying too many young lives. Our communities are plagued 
by burglaries, fraud and anti-social behaviour, and far too many criminals are 
getting away with it. Violence against women and girls remains horrifically high.

Huge backlogs in the courts are denying victims the justice they deserve. Prisons 
are in crisis: overcrowded, understaffed and failing to rehabilitate offenders.

Liberal Democrats will prevent crime and build communities where people can 
truly feel safe, including by:

&bullet; Restoring proper community policing, where officers are visible, trusted 
and focused on preventing and solving crimes - especially rape and other 
violent crime.

&bullet; Creating a new statutory guarantee that all burglaries will be attended by 
the police and properly investigated.

&bullet; Investing in the criminal justice system to tackle the backlog of court cases 
and ensure swift justice.

&bullet; Breaking the cycle of reoffending by improving rehabilitation in prisons 
and on release, and strengthening the supervision of offenders in the 
community.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ensuring survivors of violence against women and girls are properly 
supported in the criminal justice process, including through mandatory 
training for police and prosecutors in understanding the impact of trauma 
on survivors.


In addition, we will:

&bullet; Free up local officers' time to focus on their communities by: 

&bullet; Creating a new Online Crime Agency to effectively tackle illegal content and 
activity online, such as personal fraud, revenge porn and threats and 
incitement to violence on social media.

&bullet; Properly resourcing the National Crime Agency to combat serious and 
organised crime.

&bullet; Help rebuild public trust in policing by:

&bullet; Scrapping Police and Crime Commissioners and replacing them with local 
Police Boards made up of councillors and representatives from relevant local 
groups, while investing the savings in frontline policing.

&bullet; Requiring the Home Secretary, the Mayor of London and the Metropolitan 
Police Commissioner to draw up an urgent plan to implement the 
recommendations of the Baroness Casey Review and tackle sexism, racism 
and homophobia, while encouraging other police forces to do so where 
appropriate.

&bullet; Ending the disproportionate use of Stop and Search.

&bullet; Requiring all police forces to adopt ambitious targets for improving the 
diversity of their workforce and make regular progress reports to Parliament.

&bullet; Improving access to restorative justice services.

&bullet; Introducing the Hillsborough Law: a statutory duty of candour on police 
officers and all public officials, as set out in chapter 20.

&bullet; Address staffing shortages in police forces by: 

&bullet; Urgently drawing up a national recruitment, training and retention strategy to 
tackle the shortage of detectives.

Review Body to make it properly independent of government.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ensure that survivors of domestic abuse are properly supported throughout the 
criminal justice system by: 

&bullet; Embedding domestic abuse specialists in every police force and 999 operator 
assistance centre to ensure that reports from survivors are handled effectively 
and sensitively.

&bullet; Addressing the delays in domestic abuse referrals from the police to the CPS 
and subsequent decision making by the CPS, acknowledging the unique risk 
these delays can pose to women's safety. 

&bullet; Improve the police response to mental ill-health by:

&bullet; Introducing a target of one hour for handover of people suffering from mental 
health crisis from police to mental health services.

&bullet; Ensuring that all forces have a mental health professional in the control room 
at all times.

&bullet; Supporting the police to achieve adequate levels of training in mental health 
response.


&bullet; Tackle the backlogs in the criminal courts and reduce the number of people in 
prison on remand by:

&bullet; Setting a clear target of halving the time from offence to sentencing for all 
criminals, and implementing a properly funded strategy across the criminal 
justice system to achieve it.

&bullet; Implementing a new data strategy across the criminal justice system to ensure 
that capacity meets demand, and to understand the needs of all users, 
especially victims, vulnerable people and those from ethnic minority 
backgrounds.

&bullet; Developing a workforce strategy to ensure there are enough criminal 
barristers, judges and court staff.

&bullet; Improve transparency throughout the criminal justice process by enabling all 
victims to request a transcript of court proceedings free of charge.

&bullet; Address youth violence and combat knife crime by:

&bullet; Adopting a public health approach to the epidemic of youth violence which 
identifies and treats risk factors, rather than just focusing on the symptoms. 
This means police, teachers, health professionals, youth workers and social 
services all working closely together to prevent young people falling prey to 
gangs and violence.


<pb/>
&bullet; Investing in youth services that are genuinely engaging and reach more young 
people.

pre-charge diversion scheme for young people up to the age of 25, ensuring 
better outcomes for young people and less strain on police resources.

&bullet; Combat the rise of fraud and scams by:

&bullet; Naming and shaming the banks with the worst records on preventing fraud 
and reimbursing victims.

&bullet; Requiring banks to reimburse victims of automated push payment scams 
unless there is clear evidence that they are at fault.

&bullet; Launching a high-profile public awareness campaign to help people spot, 
avoid and report frauds and scams.

&bullet; Improve cooperation with our European neighbours on tackling cross-border 
crime, such as human trafficking, the illegal drug trade, cybercrime and 
terrorism, including by:

&bullet; Working with Europol and Eurojust to develop and implement a joint strategy 
for dealing with cross-border threats, with the closest possible cooperation on 
shared priorities.

&bullet; Restoring direct, real-time access for UK police to EU-wide data sharing 
systems to identify and arrest traffickers, terrorists and other international 
criminals.

&bullet; Tackle modern slavery and human trafficking by:

&bullet; Reversing the Conservatives' rollbacks of modern slavery protections.

&bullet; Establishing a powerful new Worker Protection Enforcement Authority to 
protect people in precarious work, with proactive intelligence-led enforcement 
of labour market standards and a firewall with immigration enforcement.

&bullet; Transferring responsibility for identifying modern slavery victims from the 
Home Office to local safeguarding agencies.

&bullet; Creating a financial deterrent by establishing a civil remedy for survivors 
seeking redress from their traffickers.

&bullet; Introduce new laws to crack down on puppy and kitten smuggling.


<pb/>
&bullet; Cut reoffending by:

&bullet; Ending prison overcrowding.

&bullet; Recruiting and retaining more prison officers.

&bullet; Improving the provision of training, education and work opportunities in 
prisons.

&bullet; Establishing a Women's Justice Board and providing specialist training for all 
staff in contact with women in the criminal justice system.

&bullet; Replacing Young Offender Institutions with Secure Schools and Secure 
Children's Homes.

&bullet; Ensuring that every prison has a 'through the gate' mentorship programme. 

&bullet; Introducing a National Resettlement Plan to improve the rehabilitation of 
people leaving prison and cut reoffending.

&bullet; Improving and properly funding the supervision of offenders in the 
community, with far greater coordination between the prison service, 
probation service providers, the voluntary and private sectors and local 
authorities, achieving savings in the high costs of reoffending.


<pb/>
12 Natural Environment

Protecting our precious natural environment lies at the heart of the Liberal 
Democrat approach. Everyone should be able to enjoy open green spaces, clean 
blue rivers and the beauty of Britain's coast.

The UK is facing a nature crisis. One in six species are threatened with extinction 
from Britain. Air pollution claims tens of thousands of lives every year, and costs 
the NHS billions. The Government's own Office for Environmental Protection has 
rebuked the Conservatives for falling "far short" of the action needed. The 
Conservatives are using Brexit as an opportunity to erode previously high 
environmental standards.

Nowhere is the Conservatives' lack of care for the environment clearer than the 
national sewage scandal. They are letting water company bosses get away with 
paying themselves millions of pounds in bonuses while dumping millions of tonnes 
of raw sewage into our rivers, lakes and coastal areas. Just one in seven of 
England's rivers are in good ecological health, and every single one is below 
chemical pollution standards.

Liberal Democrats have a bold plan to restore the UK's natural environment, and 
give everyone access to a clean and healthy natural world. 

We will:

&bullet; End the sewage scandal by transforming water companies into public 
benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and 
leaks end, and replacing Ofwat with a tough new regulator with new 
powers to prevent sewage dumps.

&bullet; Set meaningful and binding targets to stop the decline of our natural 
environment and 'double nature' by 2050: doubling the size of the 
Protected Area Network, doubling the area of most important wildlife 
habitats, doubling the abundance of species and doubling woodland cover 
by 2050.


<pb/>
&bullet; Plant at least 60 million trees a year, helping to restore woodland habitats, 
increase the use of sustainable wood in construction, and reach net zero.

&bullet; Pass a Clean Air Act, based on World Health Organization guidelines, 
enforced by a new Air Quality Agency.

&bullet; Strengthen the Office for Environmental Protection and provide more 
funding to the Environment Agency and Natural England to help protect 
our environment and enforce environmental laws.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Tackle the national scandal of sewage-polluted rivers, waterways and beaches, 
and make water companies work for people by:

&bullet; Introducing a Sewage Tax on water company profits.

&bullet; Enforcing existing laws to ensure that the storm overflows only function in 
exceptional circumstances. 

&bullet; Setting legally binding targets to prevent sewage dumping into bathing waters 
and highly sensitive nature sites by 2030.

&bullet; Embracing nature-based solutions to tackle the problem of sewage dumping.

&bullet; Strengthening the powers of local authorities to monitor the health of our 
rivers, lakes and coastlines, restore our natural environment and tackle climate 
change. 

&bullet; Introducing a 'blue corridor' programme for rivers, streams and lakes to 
ensure clean and healthy water and setting new 'blue flag' standards.

&bullet; Improving the quantity and quality of bathing waters and sensitive nature sites 
with more regular and robust testing of water quality.

&bullet; Giving local environmental groups a place on water companies' boards.

&bullet; Introducing a single social tariff for water bills to help eliminate water poverty 
within the next Parliament.

&bullet; Implementing Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act to require 
sustainable drainage systems in new developments.

&bullet; Mandating all water companies to publish accessible real-time data on any 
sewage they dump.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ensure everyone has access to a healthy natural environment, regardless of 
where they live, by:

&bullet; Significantly increasing the amount of accessible green space, including 
protecting up to a million acres, completing the coastal path, exploring a 'right 
to roam' for waterways and creating a new designation of National Nature 
Parks.

&bullet; Passing a new Environmental Rights Act, recognising everyone's human right 
to a healthy environment and guaranteeing access to environmental justice.

&bullet; Making sure that the UK has the highest environmental standards in the 
world.

&bullet; Protecting at least 30% of land and sea areas by 2030 for nature's recovery.

&bullet; Working together with our European neighbours to tackle the nature crisis, 
including applying to join the European Environment Agency.

&bullet; Hold businesses to account for their responsibility to the environment by:

&bullet; Introducing a general duty of care for the environment, as set out in chapter 4.

&bullet; Requiring large businesses to publish transition plans to become nature-
positive across their activities and supply chains.

&bullet; Introducing nature-related financial disclosure requirements for large 
businesses.

&bullet; Make planning work for our natural environment and ensure that developers 
pay their fair share by:

&bullet; Ensuring new developments result in significant net gain for biodiversity, with 
up to a 100% net gain for large developments. 

&bullet; Introducing a strategic Land and Sea Use Framework to effectively balance 
competing demands on our land and oceans.

&bullet; Empowering Local Nature Recovery Strategies to identify a new Wild Belt for 
nature's recovery.

&bullet; Create a nature-positive economy, tackle plastic pollution and waste, and get 
Britain recycling by:

&bullet; Introducing a deposit return scheme for food and drink bottles and 
containers, working with the devolved administrations to ensure consistency 
across the UK, learning the lessons from the difficulties with the Scottish 
scheme.


<pb/>
&bullet; Aiming for the complete elimination of non-recyclable single-use plastics 
within three years and replacing them with affordable alternatives.

&bullet; Working to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 through the UN High 
Seas Treaty and finalising a Global Plastics Treaty to cut plastic pollution 
worldwide.

&bullet; Setting an ambition of ending plastic waste exports by 2030.

&bullet; Ensure that nature-based solutions form a critical part of our strategy to tackle 
climate change by:

&bullet; Restoring our peatlands as a carbon store, and banning the use of 
horticultural peat and the routine burning of heather on peatlands. 

&bullet; Protecting and enhancing our temperate rainforest.

&bullet; Creating and restoring habitats like saltmarshes, mudflats and seagrass 
meadows to guard against coastal flooding and erosion and absorb carbon 
emissions.

&bullet; Tackling 'greenwashing' by introducing new Blue Carbon and Soils Carbon 
Standards that are properly enforced and accredited.

&bullet; Working with international partners to fight deforestation around the world.

&bullet; Creating a real network of marine protected areas, ensuring that they are fully 
protected from damaging and destructive activities, protecting and restoring 
blue carbon and ensuring climate resilience at sea.


<pb/>
13 Food and Farming

The UK's food system is failing to serve the interests of citizens, whether they are 
farmers or consumers.

Too many families simply can't afford enough healthy, nutritious food. Ultra-
processed foods, high in saturated fat, sugar and salt, are usually much cheaper 
than healthier foods - contributing to serious health problems, especially among 
poorer households.

Farmers are key allies in tackling climate change and the nature crisis, caring for 
and restoring the countryside while producing high-quality food for our tables. But 
their ability to do this is threatened by the Conservative Government's botched 
transition away from the Basic Payment Scheme. We support the move to public 
money for public goods, but many farmers are seeing their incomes threatened as 
old payments are cut and new payments are not fully rolled out or properly 
funded.

Meanwhile, farmers have had to contend with increases in bills for energy, 
fertilisers and feed. It is hardly surprising we have seen food shortages in the 
supermarkets.

The Conservatives' botched deal with the EU is also contributing to food shortages 
and high food prices, and severely damaging farmers' and fishers' ability to export 
to their main markets in Europe, while new trade deals undermine animal welfare 
and environmental protection, undercutting responsible British farmers and 
setting a dangerous precedent for future deals.

Liberal Democrats will stand up for British farmers and ensure everyone can get 
affordable, healthy and nutritious food, produced to high welfare and 
environmental standards.


<pb/>
We will:

&bullet; Introduce a holistic and comprehensive National Food Strategy to ensure 
food security, tackle rising food prices, end food poverty and improve 
health and nutrition.

&bullet; Accelerate the rollout of the new Environmental Land Management 
schemes, properly funding it with an extra &pound;1 billion a year to support 
profitable, sustainable and nature-friendly farming. 

&bullet; Maintain high health, environmental and animal welfare standards in food 
production and guarantee that all future trade deals will meet them too, 
ensuring that Britain's farmers and food manufacturers are not put at an 
unfair disadvantage.

&bullet; Give Britain's farmers the ability to trade with our European neighbours 
with minimal need for checks by negotiating comprehensive veterinary 
and plant health agreements.

&bullet; Support farmers properly in restoring woodland, peatland and waterways, 
creating new natural flood protections and managing land to encourage 
species recovery and carbon storage, while producing food for the table.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Give farmers and fishers a fair deal by:

&bullet; Introducing a range of other 'public money for public goods' programmes, 
such as nature recovery, planting trees and protecting wildlife, contingent on 
farmers and land managers opting into an Environmental Land Management 
scheme.

&bullet; Exploring additional funding options to ensure an intelligent transition to 
better farming practices.

&bullet; Investing in rural and coastal infrastructure and services, including local 
abattoirs, so that communities are viable and can attract and retain workers, 
particularly from younger age groups.


<pb/>
&bullet; Using public procurement policy to support the consumption of food 
produced to high standards of environmental and social sustainability, and 
which is nutritious, healthy and locally and seasonally sourced.

&bullet; Renegotiating the Australia and New Zealand trade agreements in line with 
our objectives for health, environmental and animal welfare standards, 
withdrawing from them if that cannot be achieved.

&bullet; Ensuring that sustainability lies at the heart of fisheries policy, rebuilding 
depleted fish stocks to achieve their former abundance, including a ban on 
bottom trawling in marine protected areas. Fishers, scientists and 
conservationists should all be at the centre of a decentralised and regionalised 
fisheries management system. 

&bullet; Strengthen the Groceries Code Adjudicator to protect consumers from unfair 
price rises and support producers.

&bullet; Ensure our farming and food system is on an environmentally sustainable 
footing by:

&bullet; Ensuring farmers receive proper, independent advice about how to transition 
to new environmental farm payments schemes, with proper funding for advice 
services.

&bullet; Supporting farmers to reduce the pollution of rivers, streams and lakes.

&bullet; Working with and rewarding farmers to reduce the use of costly imported and 
environmentally harmful artificial fertilisers and pesticides, helping to protect 
bees and other pollinators.

&bullet; Introducing a Research and Innovation Fund to support new and emerging 
technologies in the sector including the development of alternative proteins in 
which the UK can become a world leader.

&bullet; Give consumers confidence in the food they eat by:

&bullet; Providing local authorities with greater powers and resources to inspect and 
monitor food production.

&bullet; Ensuring all imported food meets UK standards for health and welfare, and 
that goods are properly checked.

&bullet; Introducing robust and clear-to-understand food labelling.


<pb/>
&bullet; Ensure Britain continues to be a world leader in animal welfare and standards 
by:

&bullet; Passing a comprehensive new Animal Welfare Bill to ensure the highest 
standards possible.

&bullet; Ensuring that no animal product that would be illegal to produce in the UK can 
be sold here, including foie gras and food produced with antibiotic growth 
promoters.

&bullet; Developing safe, effective, humane, and evidence-based ways of controlling 
bovine tuberculosis, including by investing to produce workable vaccines.

&bullet; Improving standards of animal health and welfare in agriculture, including a 
ban on caged hens, and preventing unnecessarily painful practices in farming.

&bullet; At least matching the EU's stricter rules on preventative use of antibiotics, and 
introducing a comprehensive plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance in farm 
animals.


<pb/>
14 Housing

Liberal Democrats know that a home is a necessity and the base on which people 
build their lives. So we will ensure that everyone can access housing that meets 
their needs.

Yet, in Britain today, many people cannot afford to buy or rent a home of good 
quality where they live. Too many people live in housing so poor it damages their 
health.

Government housebuilding targets are regularly missed and the shortage of 
affordable and social housing is at crisis point. Newly built homes are often energy 
inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Too many new houses are built as 
leasehold and leaseholders still face large bills, not least because of the building 
safety scandal. Homelessness remains shamefully high. Local authorities' powers 
to build the kind of homes needed in their areas are inadequate.

Liberal Democrats are committed to tackling these housing failures head-on by:

&bullet; Increasing building of new homes to 380,000 a year across the UK, 
including 150,000 social homes a year, through new garden cities and 
community-led development of cities and towns.

&bullet; Delivering a fair deal for renters by immediately banning no-fault 
evictions, making three-year tenancies the default, and creating a national 
register of licensed landlords.

&bullet; Giving local authorities, including National Park Authorities, the powers to 
end Right to Buy in their areas.

&bullet; Ending rough sleeping within the next Parliament and immediately 
scrapping the archaic Vagrancy Act.

&bullet; Abolishing residential leaseholds and capping ground rents to a nominal 
fee, so that everyone has control over their property.


<pb/>
In addition, we will:

&bullet; Build the homes people desperately need, with meaningful community 
engagement, by:

&bullet; Expanding Neighbourhood Planning across England.

&bullet; Building ten new garden cities.

&bullet; Allowing councils to buy land for housing based on current use value rather 
than on a hope-value basis by reforming the Land Compensation Act 1961.

&bullet; Properly funding local planning departments to improve planning outcomes 
and ensure housing is not built in areas of high flood risk without adequate 
mitigation, by allowing local authorities to set their own fees. 

&bullet; Encouraging the use of rural exception sites to expand rural housing.

&bullet; Trialling Community Land Auctions to ensure that local communities receive a 
fair share of the benefits of new development in their areas and to help fund 
vital local services.

&bullet; Encouraging development of existing brownfield sites with financial incentives 
and ensuring that affordable and social housing is included in these projects.

&bullet; Introducing 'use-it-or-lose-it' planning permission for developers who refuse to 
build.

&bullet; Putting the construction sector on a sustainable footing by investing in skills, 
training and new technologies such as modern methods of construction.

&bullet; Ensure that all development has appropriate infrastructure, services and 
amenities in place, integrating infrastructure and public service delivery into the 
planning process.

&bullet; Make homes warmer and cheaper to heat with a ten-year emergency upgrade 
programme, and ensure that all new homes are zero-carbon, as set out in 
chapter 5.

&bullet; Remove dangerous cladding from all buildings, while ensuring that leaseholders 
do not have to pay a penny towards it.

&bullet; Help people who cannot afford a deposit to own their own homes by 
introducing a new Rent to Own model for social housing where rent payments 
give tenants an increasing stake in the property, owning it outright after 30 
years.


<pb/>
&bullet; End rough sleeping within the next Parliament by:

&bullet; Urgently publishing a cross-Whitehall plan to end all forms of homelessness.

&bullet; Exempting groups of homeless people, and those at risk of homelessness, 
from the Shared Accommodation Rate.

&bullet; Introducing a 'somewhere safe to stay' legal duty to ensure that everyone who 
is at risk of sleeping rough is provided with emergency accommodation and an 
assessment of their needs.

&bullet; Ensuring sufficient financial resources for local authorities to deliver the 
Homelessness Reduction Act and provide accommodation for survivors of 
domestic abuse.

&bullet; Give local authorities new powers to control second homes and short-term lets 
in their areas, as set out in chapter 15.

&bullet; Protect the rights of social renters by:

&bullet; Proactively enforcing clear standards for homes that are socially rented, 
including strict time limits for repairs.

&bullet; Fully recognising tenant panels so that renters have a voice in landlord 
governance.


<pb/>
15 Communities and Local 
Government

People want to live in flourishing communities. No community can flourish without 
powers and resources.

Liberal Democrats are committed to allowing communities to take the action they 
need to improve their areas. We believe, for example, that given sufficient powers 
and resources local authorities can play a major role in combating the climate and 
nature emergencies, whether by insulating homes or improving air quality.

Yet this Government is robbing local communities of their powers and their 
resources. The Conservatives have forced councils to do more and more with less 
and less, plunging many into financial crisis. In rural areas, the growth of second 
homes, the lack of public transport and poor broadband connectivity are 
undermining the viability of our communities.

Liberal Democrats will support local government through these difficult times, and 
review the burdens and costs that councils have shouldered as a result of 
Conservative Government policies. This includes tackling the social care funding 
crisis, giving councils the freedom to set planning fees to reflect the actual cost of 
delivering an efficient planning service, and building more homes to relieve the 
soaring demand for temporary accommodation.

We will:

multi-year settlements, boosting the supply of social housing, and forging 
a long-term, cross-party agreement on social care.

&bullet; Encourage post offices to become community banking and government hubs, 
and keep DVLA services available at post office counters.

16 Transport

Everyone should have convenient, affordable options to get around - whether to 
get to work or the shops, to go to school or hospital, to visit friends and families or 
to access other services. A safe, reliable transport system is vital for economic 
prosperity in all parts of the country. And improving transport is essential to 
combat climate change and air pollution.

Conservative Ministers have badly neglected our transport infrastructure. Their 
chaotic U-turns have seriously undermined the rail industry, electric vehicle 
manufacturing and regional development. They have failed to rollout electric 
charging points at anything like the speed necessary, and they have left local bus 
routes in rapid decline. Roads are in a terrible state, with potholes everywhere.

By investing in electric vehicles and clean public transport, as well as encouraging 
walking and cycling, Liberal Democrats will enhance local, regional and national 
connectivity while boosting the economy, protecting the environment and 
improving public health.

We will:

&bullet; Make it cheaper and easier for drivers to switch to electric vehicles by 
rapidly rolling out far more charging points, reintroducing the plug-in car 
grant, and restoring the requirement that every new car and small van 
sold from 2030 is zero-emission.

&bullet; Freeze rail fares and simplify ticketing on public transport to ensure 
regular users are paying fair and affordable prices.

&bullet; Significantly extend the electrification of Britain's rail network, improve 
stations, greatly improve disabled access, reopen smaller stations and 
deliver Northern Powerhouse rail.

&bullet; Boost bus services by giving local authorities more powers to franchise 
services and simplifying funding, so that bus routes can be restored or 
new routes added where there is local need, especially in rural areas.


<pb/>
&bullet; Transform how people travel by creating new cycling and walking 
networks with a new nationwide active travel strategy.

&bullet; Give more of the roads budget to local councils to maintain existing roads, 
pavements and cycleways, including repairing potholes.

&bullet; Invest in research and development to make the UK the world leader in 
zero-carbon flight, and take steps to reduce demand for flying.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Make it easy and cheap to charge electric vehicles by:

&bullet; Rolling out far more charging points, including residential on-street points and 
ultra-fast chargers at service stations.

&bullet; Supporting new charging points with an upgraded National Grid and a step-
change in local grid capacity.

&bullet; Cutting VAT on public charging to 5%.

&bullet; Requiring all charging points to be accessible with a bank card.

&bullet; Protect motorists from rip-offs, including unfair insurance and petrol prices.

&bullet; Boost bus services by:

&bullet; Supporting rural bus services and encouraging alternatives to conventional 
bus services where they are not viable, such as on-demand services.

&bullet; Maintaining the &pound;2 cap on bus fares while fares are reviewed.

&bullet; Replacing multiple funding streams with one integrated fund for local 
authorities for expanding bus services and switching to zero-emission vehicles.

&bullet; Extending current programmes to encourage local authorities and bus 
operators to switch entirely to zero-emission buses.

&bullet; Make rail a genuinely convenient, affordable and environmentally-friendly option 
for both passengers and freight by:

&bullet; Urgently establishing a new Railway Agency: a public body which would help to 
join up the industry - from track to train - putting commuters first, holding 
train companies to account, and bringing in wholesale reform of the broken 
fare system.


<pb/>
&bullet; Being far more proactive in sanctioning and ultimately sacking train operators 
if they fail to provide a high-quality public service to their customers.

&bullet; Exploring the introduction of an annual pass for all railways.

&bullet; Improving accessibility at stations through the Access for All programme.

&bullet; Delivering Northern Powerhouse Rail to connect cities across the North of 
England. 

&bullet; Reviewing the Conservatives' cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 to see if it 
can still be delivered in a way that provides value for money, including by 
encouraging private investment, or if an alternative is viable.

&bullet; Working with local authorities to implement light rail schemes for trams and 
tram-trains where these are appropriate solutions to public transport 
requirements.

&bullet; Establishing a ten-year plan for rail electrification to increase the number of 
passenger journeys covered by electric trains, investing in other zero-carbon 
technologies including batteries, and ensuring all new rail lines are electrified 
as standard.

&bullet; Introducing a national freight strategy to move as much freight as possible 
from road to rail, supported by a freight growth target and electrification of 
freight routes.

&bullet; Introducing an international rail strategy to support new routes and operators, 
and permitting other operators to use the Channel Tunnel and HS1.

&bullet; Make public transport more affordable for young people by:

&bullet; Extending half-fares on buses, trams and trains to 18-year-olds.

&bullet; Working with operators to introduce a 'Young Person's Buscard', similar to the 
Young Person's Railcard, giving 19- to 25-year-olds a third off bus and tram 
fares.

&bullet; Reduce the climate impact of flying by:

&bullet; Reforming the taxation of international flights to focus on those who fly the 
most, while reducing costs for ordinary households who take one or two 
international return flights per year.

&bullet; Introducing a new super tax on private jet flights, and removing the VAT 
exemptions for private, first-class and business-class flights.

&bullet; Requiring airlines to show the carbon emissions for domestic flights compared 
to the equivalent rail option at booking.


<pb/>
&bullet; Banning short domestic flights where a direct rail option taking less than 2.5 
hours is available for the same journey, unless planes are alternative-fuelled.

&bullet; Placing a moratorium on net airport expansion until a national capacity and 
emissions management framework is in place, and opposing the expansion of 
Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted or London City airports and any new 
airport in the Thames Estuary.

&bullet; Devolve greater decision-making powers and resources to local authorities in 
England to design public transport infrastructure around community needs, 
including powers to introduce network-wide ticketing as in London.

&bullet; Work to integrate bus, rail and light rail ticketing systems so that a daily fare cap 
can be introduced for those taking several trips per day.


<pb/>
17 Culture, Media and Sport

The UK's rich and vibrant cultural heritage is a national treasure. Our creative and 
tourism industries contribute billions of pounds to our economy and employ 
millions of people. Art, music, drama and sports bring people together. They are 
an essential part of a thriving society.

The Covid pandemic hit culture and tourism businesses extremely hard. And 
instead of helping, the Conservatives have only inflicted even more damage. They 
have downgraded the status of arts subjects at school, slashed funding for them 
at university, and erected new barriers to British musicians and actors performing 
elsewhere in Europe following our withdrawal from the EU.

Liberal Democrats will invest in our cultural capital and nurture the next 
generation of talent. We will support the creative and tourism industries across 
the UK so that businesses can thrive and people everywhere can enjoy the 
benefits of sports, music and the arts.

We will:

&bullet; Protect the BBC, S4C, BBC Alba and Channel 4 as independent, publicly 
owned, public service broadcasters.

&bullet; Promote creative skills, address the barriers to finance faced by small 
businesses, and support modern and flexible patent, copyright and 
licensing rules.

&bullet; Negotiate free and simple short-term travel arrangements for UK artists to 
perform in the EU, and European artists to perform in the UK.

&bullet; Boost participation in sports and physical activity by investing in leisure 
centres, swimming pools and other grassroots facilities and supporting 
community sports clubs.


<pb/>
In addition, we will:

&bullet; Establish creative enterprise zones to grow and regenerate the cultural output 
of areas across the UK.

&bullet; Upgrade the status of tourism in government with a dedicated Minister of State 
for Tourism and Hospitality.

&bullet; Maintain free access to national museums and galleries.

&bullet; Boost funding for cultural and creative projects by applying to participate fully in 
Creative Europe.

&bullet; Require at least 80% of on-demand TV content to be subtitled, 10% audio-
described and 5% signed.

&bullet; Support independent, Leveson-compliant regulation to ensure privacy, quality, 
diversity and choice in both print and online media, and proceed with Part Two 
of the Leveson Inquiry.

&bullet; Pass a comprehensive 'Anti-SLAPP Law' to provide robust protection for free 
speech, whistleblowers and media scrutiny against Strategic Lawsuits Against 
Public Participation.

&bullet; Support the BBC both to provide impartial news and information, and to take a 
leading role in increasing media literacy and educating all generations in tackling 
the impact of fake news.

&bullet; Protect fans from being exploited by ticket touts by implementing the 
Competition and Markets Authority's recommendations to crack down on illegal 
ticket resale.

&bullet; Protect sports and arts funding via the National Lottery.


<pb/>
&bullet; Combat the harms caused by problem gambling by:

&bullet; Introducing the planned compulsory levy on gambling companies to fund 
research, prevention and treatment.

&bullet; Establishing a Gambling Ombudsman to redress wrongs.

&bullet; Implementing effective affordability checks.

&bullet; Taking tough action against black market gambling.

&bullet; Ensure a sustainable future for football clubs and give fans a stronger voice by:

&bullet; Establishing the promised new independent regulator, placing it on a statutory 
footing, and giving it the power to impose a fairer financial flow that rewards 
well-run clubs.

&bullet; Strengthening the propriety test for prospective owners and directors by 
including human rights questions.

&bullet; Requiring all clubs to have equality, diversity and inclusion action plans.

&bullet; Expand the list of sporting fixtures which must have live free-to-air coverage to 
include more football matches as well as key international cricket, rugby, golf 
and tennis fixtures.

&bullet; Support and encourage campaigns to improve equality, diversity and inclusion in 
sport. 


<pb/>
18 Immigration and Asylum

The UK has a proud history of welcoming newcomers - whether people seeking to 
build their lives here, or refugees fleeing war and persecution. People from all over 
the world have greatly enriched our economy, our culture and our communities.

But our immigration system has been broken by the Conservatives. Their 
damaging new rules mean British employers can't recruit the people they need 
and families are separated by unfair, complex visa requirements. Their dysfunction 
has made the asylum backlog soar. Public confidence in the system is shattered. 
The Home Office is not fit for purpose. 

Meanwhile, the Conservatives have closed down safe and legal routes to 
sanctuary, leaving desperate people to make perilous attempts to cross the 
Channel in small boats - often in the hands of criminal smugglers and traffickers.

Liberal Democrats are fighting for a fair, effective immigration system that treats 
everyone with dignity and respect.

We will:

&bullet; End the Conservatives' Hostile Environment and invest instead in officers, 
training and technology to tackle smuggling, trafficking and modern 
slavery.

&bullet; Transfer policy-making over work visas and overseas students out of the 
Home Office and into other departments.

&bullet; Scrap the Conservatives' Illegal Migration Act and their Rwanda scheme, 
uphold the Refugee Convention, and provide safe and legal routes to 
sanctuary for refugees, helping to prevent dangerous Channel crossings.

&bullet; Tackle the asylum backlog by establishing a dedicated unit to improve the 
speed and quality of asylum decision-making, introducing a service 
standard of three months for all but the most complex asylum claims to be 
processed, and speeding up returns of those without a right to stay.


<pb/>
&bullet; Lift the ban on asylum seekers working if they have been waiting for a 
decision for more than three months, enabling them to support 
themselves, integrate in their communities and contribute to the 
economy.

&bullet; Work closely with Europol and the French authorities to stop the 
smuggling and trafficking gangs behind dangerous Channel crossings.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Replace the Conservatives' arbitrary salary threshold with a more flexible 
merit-based system for work visas, with the relevant department working with 
employers in each sector to address specific needs as part of a long-term 
workforce strategy that also focuses on education and training to address skills 
gaps from within the UK.

&bullet; Exempt NHS and care staff from the &pound;1,000-a-year Immigration Skills Charge, 
and reverse the Conservatives' ban on care workers bringing partners and 
children.

&bullet; Expand the Youth Mobility Scheme by:

&bullet; Negotiating with the EU to extend it on a reciprocal basis.

&bullet; Increasing the age limit from 30 to 35.

&bullet; Abolishing the fees for these visas.

&bullet; Extending the length of visas from two to three years.

&bullet; Reverse the Conservatives' unfair increase to income thresholds for family visas, 
so that no more families are torn apart.

&bullet; Protect the rights of EU citizens and their families in the UK by:

&bullet; Automatically granting full Settled Status to all those with Pre-Settled Status.

&bullet; Providing them with physical proof of their right to stay.

&bullet; Reduce the fee for registering a child as a British citizen from &pound;1,214 to the cost 
of administration.

&bullet; Overhaul the Immigration Rules to make them simpler, clearer and fairer, and 
ensure greater parliamentary scrutiny of future changes.


<pb/>
eGuide Travel CC BY 2.0


<pb/>
&bullet; Extend the participation of devolved administrations in the development of the 
evidence base for UK-wide policy on work permits and student visas, helping 
ensure rules are sensitive to the skills needs of every corner of the UK and every 
sector of the economy.

&bullet; Strengthen the powers of the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and 
Immigration.

&bullet; Implement the Windrush Lessons Learned Review in full, without further delay.

&bullet; Ensure victims of the Windrush scandal get the compensation they are entitled 
to by making the compensation scheme independent of the Home Office.

&bullet; Repeal the Conservatives' discriminatory 'Right to Rent' scheme that turns 
landlords into border guards.

&bullet; Establish a firewall to prevent public agencies from sharing personal information 
with the Home Office for the purposes of immigration enforcement and repeal 
the immigration exemption in the Data Protection Act.

&bullet; Expand access to immigration legal advice by making the legal aid system 
simpler, fairer and more generous, as set out in chapter 19.

&bullet; Provide safe and legal routes to sanctuary for refugees by:

&bullet; Creating new humanitarian travel permits that would allow asylum seekers to 
travel to the UK safely to proceed with their claims.

elsewhere in Europe.

community groups who develop innovative and successful ways of promoting 
social cohesion.


<pb/>
&bullet; Offering asylum to people fleeing the risk of violence because of their sexual 
orientation or gender identification, ending the culture of disbelief for LGBT+ 
asylum seekers, and never refusing an LGBT+ applicant on the basis that they 
could be discreet.

&bullet; Cancel the Conservatives' unworkable Rwanda scheme and invest the savings in 
clearing the asylum backlog.

&bullet; End the detention of children for immigration purposes, and reduce detention 
for adults to an absolute last resort, with a 28-day time limit.

&bullet; Increase the 'move-on' period for refugees to 60 days, providing vital time for 
new refugees to prepare for life in the UK while ensuring that other public 
bodies are not left to pick up the costs of them becoming destitute.


<pb/>
19 Rights and Equality

Liberal Democrats exist to build a free society where every person's rights and 
liberties are protected. Everyone should be able to live their lives as who they are: 
free to pursue their dreams and fulfil their potential, safe in the knowledge that 
their fundamental rights will be protected.

In decades past, the UK has led the world in advancing human rights, civil liberties 
and equality for women, LGBT+ people and disabled people. But under the 
Conservatives, progress has stalled. They are failing to stand up to hatred and 
prejudice, or tackle entrenched inequalities. Instead, they keep threatening to rip 
up the UK's Human Rights Act, which protects our fundamental British freedoms.

Liberal Democrats champion the freedom, dignity and wellbeing of every 
individual. We will combat all forms of prejudice and discrimination, wherever they 
exist, including where intersectionality means individuals face particular 
disadvantages.

We believe that the UK's rich diversity is one of its greatest strengths. We will 
celebrate that diversity and ensure it is better reflected throughout public life. We 
will apply the principles of openness, transparency and accountability to tackle 
institutional biases, promote equality and hold power to account.

We will:

&bullet; Champion the Human Rights Act and resist any attempts to weaken or 
repeal it.

&bullet; Develop and implement a comprehensive Race Equality Strategy to 
address deep inequalities, including in education, health, criminal justice 
and the economy.

&bullet; Make misogyny a hate crime and give police and prosecutors the 
resources and training they need to prevent and prosecute all hate crimes 
while supporting survivors.

the right to work from home if they want to, unless there are significant 
business reasons why it is not possible.

&bullet; Respect and defend the rights of people of all sexual orientations and 
gender identities, including trans and non-binary people.

&bullet; Ban all forms of conversion therapies and practices.

&bullet; Scrap the Conservatives' draconian anti-protest laws, restoring pre-
existing protections for both peaceful assembly and public safety, and 
immediately halt the use of live facial recognition surveillance by the 
police and private companies.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Defend hard-won British rights and freedoms by:

&bullet; Upholding the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human 
Rights and resisting any attempts to withdraw from it.

&bullet; Establishing a new right to affordable, reasonable legal assistance, and making 
the Legal Aid system simpler, fairer and more generous.

violence against women and domestic violence, with protections for all 
survivors regardless of nationality or immigration status.

&bullet; Expanding the number of refuges and rape crisis centres to meet demand.

have taken to address online abuse against women and girls, and other groups 
who share a protected characteristic.

public life and the media that inflames hatred and leads to spikes in hate 
crimes.

&bullet; Providing funding for protective security measures to places of worship, 
schools and community centres that are vulnerable to hate crime and terror 
attacks.

&bullet; Expand the rights of couples by:

&bullet; Providing additional support and advice to employers on neurodiversity in the 
workplace, and developing a cross-government strategy to tackle all aspects of 
discrimination faced by neurodiverse children and adults.

<pb/>
20 Political Reform

We want to ensure that your voice is heard - and we want to transfer power back 
to the people.

The shambolic Conservative Government has created a crisis for democracy in this 
country, with their cronyism, rule-breaking and constant sleaze scandals. 
Successive Conservative Prime Ministers have acted without integrity and treated 
Parliament and the people with disdain.

It is a symptom of a broken political system, which enables the Government to 
take families up and down the country for granted. It is clear that we need a 
political system with fair representation, so that politics is made to work for you 
again.

Liberal Democrats want to begin to repair the damage that has been done by the 
constant stream of Conservative sleaze, and to end the era of neglect.

We will:

&bullet; Ensure no politician can take you for granted, by introducing proportional 
representation by the Single Transferable Vote for electing MPs, and local 
councillors in England.

&bullet; Strengthen democratic rights and participation by scrapping the 
Conservatives' voter ID scheme and giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to 
vote.

&bullet; Finally hold Government Ministers to account for corruption and sleaze by 
enshrining the Ministerial Code in legislation.

&bullet; Reform the House of Lords with a proper democratic mandate.


<pb/>
&bullet; Transfer greater powers away from Westminster and Whitehall, introduce 
a written constitution for a federal United Kingdom with strong voices for 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and oppose a second 
Scottish independence referendum and independence.

&bullet; Take big money out of politics by capping donations to political parties.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Reform our politics to put more power in people's hands by:

&bullet; Giving 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in UK general elections and 
referendums, and local elections in England.

&bullet; Extending the right to full participation in civic life, including the ability to stand 
for office or vote in UK referendums, local elections and general elections, to 
all EU citizens with settled status, and to anyone else who has lived in the UK 
for at least five years and has the right to stay permanently.

&bullet; Introducing a legal requirement for local authorities to inform citizens of the 
steps they must take to be successfully registered with far greater efforts in 
particular to register underrepresented groups, and ensuring that the UK has 
an automatic system of inclusion in elections.

&bullet; Enabling all UK citizens living abroad to vote for MPs in separate overseas 
constituencies, and to participate in UK referendums.

&bullet; Restoring to Parliament - instead of the Prime Minister alone - the power to 
call and set the date of an early general election.

&bullet; Ensuring that a new Prime Minister, and their programme for government, 
must win a confidence vote of MPs before taking office.

&bullet; Taking a zero-tolerance approach to harassment and bullying in Westminster 
and legislating to empower constituents to recall MPs who commit sexual 
harassment.

&bullet; Bringing into force Section 106 of the Equality Act 2010, requiring political 
parties to publish candidate diversity data.

&bullet; Establishing national and local citizens' assemblies to ensure that the public 
are fully engaged in finding solutions to the greatest challenges we face, such 
as tackling the climate emergency and the use of artificial intelligence and 
algorithms by the state.


<pb/>
&bullet; Make it a national security priority to protect the UK's democratic processes 
from any threats or interference.

&bullet; Ensure justice for the victims of scandals and prevent future scandals, including 
by:

&bullet; Providing full and fair compensation to all victims of the Horizon Post Office 
scandal and the Infected Blood scandal as quickly as possible.

21 Defence

Keeping our country secure should be the first priority of any government. We 
must always take defence seriously - and work with allies to protect all our 
freedoms.

The Conservative Government has been negligent in its approach to the defence 
of the United Kingdom. Cutting troop numbers by 10,000 is irresponsible. Their 
inability to procure assets on time and on budget is leaving our Armed Forces 
without the equipment they need. And their failure to look after service personnel 
and veterans properly - from suitable housing to mental health support - is 
unforgivable.

The spectre of Donald Trump returning to power in the United States - and his 
lack of support for Ukraine and for NATO - should shake the UK and our European 
partners out of their state of complacency when it comes to the defence and 
security of our continent.

It is time for the UK to lead within Europe on security, working closely with our 
democratic European allies so that we can support Ukraine, and each other, 
during peace and war.

Liberal Democrats will strengthen our Armed Forces and support the people who 
work in them, and keep the UK free, safe and secure by:

&bullet; Reversing the Conservative Government's cut to the Army, with a longer-
term ambition of increasing regular troop numbers back to over 100,000.

&bullet; Maintaining the UK's support for NATO, and accordingly increasing 
defence spending in every year of the Parliament, with an ambition to 
spend at least 2.5% of GDP on defence.

&bullet; Securing a fair deal for service personnel and veterans.


<pb/>
&bullet; Maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent with four submarines providing 
continuous at-sea deterrence, while pursuing multilateral global 
disarmament.

&bullet; Controlling arms exports to countries with poor human rights records.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Legislate to ensure there is a parliamentary vote before engaging in military 
action, and support intervention only when there is a clear legal or humanitarian 
case, while preserving the government's ability to engage in action in 
emergencies with a retrospective vote or under treaty obligation.

&bullet; Introduce a 'presumption of denial' for arms exports to governments listed as 
human rights concerns in the Foreign Office's annual human rights report.

&bullet; Strengthen the Intelligence and Security Committee by giving it the power to 
decide what it publishes and when, and enabling the Houses of Parliament to 
elect its members.

&bullet; Tackle long-standing problems in defence procurement, including by ensuring 
that procurement is part of a comprehensive industrial strategy to secure a 
reliable long-term pipeline of equipment procurements, which will strengthen 
the Army, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and Strategic Command.

&bullet; Support and promote the development of international treaties on the 
principles and limits of the use of technology in modern warfare.

&bullet; Secure a fair deal for the armed forces community, and improve recruitment, 
retention and resettlement, by:

&bullet; Strengthening the Armed Forces Covenant by placing a legal duty on the 
Defence Secretary and government departments to give it due regard. 

&bullet; Improving the standard of Ministry of Defence housing, including by reviewing 
maintenance contracts.

&bullet; Waiving application fees for indefinite leave for members of the armed forces 
on discharge, and their families.

&bullet; Accepting the recommendations of the Atherton Report on women in the 
armed forces.

&bullet; Ensuring that military compensation for illness or injury does not count 
towards means-testing for benefits.

&bullet; Establishing a 'Fair Deal for Service Personnel, Veterans and Families 
Commission'.

&bullet; Work collaboratively with our democratic European partners and promote 
security, including through deterrence, by:

&bullet; Strengthening cooperation with our Nordic and Baltic allies via the Joint 
Expeditionary Force.

&bullet; Building on existing UK-French cooperation arrangements, including the 
Lancaster House Treaties.

&bullet; Developing closer cooperation with EU agencies and member states over 
defence, intelligence and cyber-security.

&bullet; Prioritising interoperability with NATO allies and other strategic partners.

&bullet; Working more closely in the joint development of innovative defence 
technologies and procurement.

&bullet; Seeking a defence and security agreement with the EU and its member states.

&bullet; Continuing to work closely with our Five Eyes partners.

22 International

Whether on apartheid in South Africa, the illegal war in Iraq or the persecution of 
Hong Kongers, Liberal Democrats have always stood up for the vital British values 
of democracy, liberty, human rights and the rule of law. We will resist those states 
that threaten us and robustly challenge our allies when necessary. 

The UK must support democracies around the world, especially those threatened 
by aggression such as Ukraine and Taiwan. We must stand up to states like China 
and Russia, resisting their attempts to undermine our democratic values and 
preventing them from filling the vacuum that the UK has left in Africa and the rest 
of the Global South, following the Government's short-sighted cut to the aid 
budget.

Following years of Conservative Government, our influence on the world stage is 
sadly but undeniably diminished. Liberal Democrats will reverse this decline. We 
will rebuild our relations with our allies - not trash them. We will uphold 
international law - not undermine it. We will restore Britain's role as an 
international development superpower.

With war raging on our continent, now more than ever Britain must lead within 
Europe. Liberal Democrats are the only party that will fix the UK's broken 
relationship with Europe, by following our four-stage roadmap. Not only will this 
leave us and our allies more secure, but it will help restore the British economy 
and the prosperity and opportunities of its citizens.

We will:

&bullet; Work to counter the global rise in authoritarianism by championing the 
liberal, rules-based international order and supporting international 
institutions such as the United Nations, the Commonwealth, NATO and the 
International Criminal Court.

&bullet; Fix the UK's broken relationship with Europe, forge a new partnership 
built on cooperation, not confrontation, and move to conclude a new 
comprehensive agreement which removes as many barriers to trade 
as possible.


<pb/>
&bullet; Stand with the people of Ukraine and provide them with the support that 
they need in the face of Putin's illegal invasion. 

&bullet; Restore the UK's reputation as an international development superpower, 
by returning spending to 0.7% of national income and re-establishing an 
independent international development department.

&bullet; Advocate for an immediate bilateral ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict to 
resolve the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, get the hostages out, and 
provide the space to reach a two-state solution based on 1967 borders 
with security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians.

In addition, we will:

&bullet; Protect, defend and promote human rights for all around the world by:

&bullet; Working to abolish the death penalty and end the use of torture.

&bullet; Using the UK's Magnitsky sanctions to stand up against human rights abuses.

&bullet; Banning imports from areas with egregious abuses such as Xinjiang.

&bullet; Enshrining in law a right for British nationals, including dual nationals, who 
have been politically detained or face other human rights violations abroad to 
access UK consular services.

&bullet; Developing a comprehensive strategy for promoting the decriminalisation of 
homosexuality and advancing LGBT+ rights.

&bullet; Appointing an ambassador-level Champion for Freedom of Belief.

&bullet; Fix the UK's broken relationship with Europe by following our four-stage 
roadmap:

&bullet; Taking initial unilateral steps to rebuild the relationship, starting by declaring a 
fundamental change in the UK's approach and improving channels for foreign 
policy cooperation.

&bullet; Rebuilding confidence through seeking to agree partnerships or associations 
with EU agencies and programmes such as the European Aviation Safety 
Agency, Erasmus Plus, scientific programmes, climate and environment 
initiatives, and cooperation on defence, security and crime.

&bullet; Deepening the trading relationship with critical steps for the British economy, 
including negotiating comprehensive veterinary and plant health agreements 
and mutual recognition agreements.

<pb/>
&bullet; Finally, once ties of trust and friendship have been renewed, and the damage 
the Conservatives have caused to trade between the UK and EU has begun to 
be repaired, we would aim to place the UK-EU relationship on a more formal 
and stable footing by seeking to join the Single Market.

All these measures will help to restore the British economy and the prosperity 
and opportunities of its citizens, and are also essential steps on the road to EU 
membership, which remains our longer-term objective.

&bullet; Restore the UK's role as a global leader in tackling the climate and nature 
emergencies, as set out in chapters 5 and 12.

&bullet; Finally put a stop to oligarchs from corrupt regimes channelling their money 
through the UK by:

&bullet; Beginning the seizure of frozen Russian assets in the UK, with proceeds being 
repurposed to finance support for Ukraine, so that we can stand with Ukraine 
even if US support wavers. 

&bullet; Properly resourcing the National Crime Agency.

&bullet; Closing the loopholes in economic crime legislation which allow Putin's cronies 
and other kleptocrats to continue funnelling dirty cash into our country.

&bullet; Effectively using the UK's sanctions regime to tackle economic crime.

&bullet; Conducting an audit of UK-based assets owned by officials from countries 
listed as Foreign Office human rights priorities, including China and Iran.

&bullet; Work with our allies to help bring security and stability to the Middle East, which 
has become a tinderbox amidst the Israel-Gaza conflict, including by:

&bullet; Advocating for an immediate bilateral ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict, 
recognising that there is no military solution to remove Hamas from Gaza.

&bullet; Leading a diplomatic push towards a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine 
based on 1967 borders, to deliver the security and dignity that Israelis and 
Palestinians deserve.

&bullet; Officially recognising the independent state of Palestine with immediate effect.

&bullet; Recognising the existential threat of Iran not just in the Middle East but to 
Western democracies, by proscribing Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

&bullet; Upholding and respecting international courts and international law.


<pb/>
&bullet; Stand with Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Uyghurs including by:

&bullet; Continuing to fight for British National (Overseas) passport holders' rights by 
closing gaps in the BNO visa scheme. 

&bullet; Extending BNO integration funding for Hong Kongers in the UK for the 
duration of the Parliament.

&bullet; Recognising that the human rights abuses being perpetrated against the 
Uyghurs in Xinjiang amount to the crime of genocide.

&bullet; Building new diplomatic, economic and security partnerships with democratic 
countries threatened by China, including Taiwan.

&bullet; Work with the international community and neighbouring countries on the 
provision of safe, legal passages for those who wish to leave Afghanistan, and 
support Afghan refugees in the UK.

&bullet; Increase UK humanitarian assistance to Sudan and play a stronger role in 
seeking a ceasefire and long-term peace where civilians form a democratic 
government and war crimes are prosecuted.

&bullet; Provide safe and legal routes to sanctuary for refugees, as set out in chapter 18.

&bullet; Properly fund the impartial BBC World Service from the Foreign Office budget 
and restore its global reach. 

&bullet; Pursue a foreign policy agenda with gender equality at its heart, focusing on:

&bullet; The transformation of the position of women through economic inclusion.

&bullet; Education and training, ensuring the lives of women and girls are not ignored 
in favour of trade or regional alliances.

&bullet; Working to extend reproductive rights and end female genital mutilation.

&bullet; The eradication of sexual violence in conflict, including by increasing 
international development funding for such initiatives.

&bullet; Ensure that the UK's international development spending is used effectively and 
with a primary focus on poverty reduction, as we reverse the Official 
Development Assistance cut, including by:

&bullet; Putting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals at the heart of the 
UK's international development policy.


<pb/>
&bullet; Funding genuine partnerships that are rooted in local needs and developed 
on grounds of mutual respect.

&bullet; Ensuring that the use of the international development budget continues to 
be consistent with the OECD/DAC rules and guidelines, and with UK legislation, 
and in particular its primary purpose should remain the economic 
development of, and poverty reduction within, the partner country.

&bullet; Recognising the role of education as a force for good, and committing to 
spend 15% of ODA on education in the world's most vulnerable areas, 
especially focusing on girls and young women.

&bullet; Increasing the proportion of ODA committed to tackling climate change and 
environmental degradation, in line with our commitment to climate justice.

&bullet; Tackling the growing global crisis of food insecurity and malnutrition by 
increasing the proportion of ODA committed to delivering life-saving nutrition 
interventions.

This manifesto sets out Liberal Democrat policies and priorities for the United 
Kingdom. The Scottish and Welsh Liberal Democrats set their own policy on 
devolved matters, and for those policy areas, the proposals here apply to England 
only. Our sister party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, makes its own policy on 
devolved issues in Northern Ireland.
